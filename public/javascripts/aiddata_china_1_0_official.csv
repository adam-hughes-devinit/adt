67,China,Agricultural development,2009,FALSE,"In 2009, Angola secured a $1.2 billion USD loan from China to be spent on developing its agricultural sector. The China Development Bank is responsible for funding the loan. The project aims to guarantee the supply of goods like coffee, sisal, sugar cane, and cotton, while creating jobs in rural and poor areas. The World Bank believes up to $8 billion USD more has not been publicized; many news reports said more than 1 billion was provided as a line of credit. After a meeting with the Angolan head of state in 2009, the chairman of the EXIM bank said â€œWe are ready to provide a credit line worth over US$1 billion, but we think the amount is insufficient and that it could be increased to meet Angolaâ€™s concrete needs in the areas of agriculture, grain production, and processing agricultural products.â€ The loan is to be repaid in oil exports to China and by awarding contracts for project to Chinese companies. How exactly the funds were used is unclear. In 2011 it was reported that CITIC and China Development Bank are undertaking a $100 million agriculture project, which aims to produce food for local consumption, possibly in conjunction with this loan. In 2012 there was evidence that CITIC had successfully launched a centre of studies of agricultural researching in Angola.

131,China,Railway Equipment Purchase,2005,FALSE,"(PPIAF) In November of 2005, Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohama and Chinese Politburo member Li Chang Chun witnessed the signing of a 250 million Yuan concessional loan to be used for purchasing locomotives and trains for a new railway being built in the north. The loan was granted by the Export-Import Bank of China, but the trains and locomotives have already been purchased, and TransNamib will deliver the first four machines for $12 million USD each. From a report in 2008, it appears that TransNamib ultimately purchased 17 red Chinese-made locomotives in addition to the four blue ones originally purchased. However, these purchases appear to be a strain on the company because of chronic mechanical problems. The project is likely tied with mineral resources, especially uranium.

149,China,Sinosure prevents default on French loan to Ghana Telecom for Phase 2 of telecom upgrades,2005,FALSE," In 2003, Ghana Telecom and Alcatel Shanghai Bell signed a $150 million USD contract to provide 650,000 telephone lines, introduce broadband services, centralize a billing system, process and improve the quality of GT's services over the following three years. Ghanaian Minister of Communications Albert Kan Dapaah, Chinese ambassador to Ghana Lu Yonjshou, CEO of GT Oystein Bjorge, and Chairman of Alcatel Shanghai Bell Yuan Xin are all familiar with the project. In December 2003, the project was suspended because of a lawsuit against GT by Malaysian G-Gom. According to reports in 2005, the project was continued with the installation of 250 radio antenna to serve about 400,000 mobile phone users with the help of 60 Chinese engineers. It is still unclear if the project was completed. There appears to be some discrepancy between the amounts, reports include $67 million USD and $79 million USD, but it is unclear exactly how the money was designated. Sources confirmed that Phase 2 was beginning in 2005. In 2005, Ghana Telecom signed a buyer credit agreement with Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Bank (SG CIB) worth $67 million USD. The agreement carried a maturity of 6 years. Funds would be used to upgrade and expand Ghana Telecom's networks, financing the import of equipment from Alcatel Shanghai Bell. The loan is insured by Sinosure, the Chinese export credit agency. Phase 2 of Ghana telecom project includes the supply of fixed network exchanges, mobile network equipment, and optical transfer equipment. Sinosure prevented default on this deal, after receiving preliminary notice of potential default in February 2007. There is some confusion that Phase 2 might be a 50-50 Chinese-French joint venture. The total cost for Phase 2 appears to be $80 million USD, and the Chinese will commit $67 million USD.

Contract details reveal 35 per cent of the total investment would be paid in cash by the Nigerian side within a month, with the remaining 65 per cent taking the form of loans. The loan stipulates $114.9 million for the project's 335MW power plant, signed in 2002, at 6% interest, a grace period of 6 years, maturity in 12 years.The total cost of the project was $359.71 million, with a Chinese commitment of $297.75 million funded by the Export-Import Bank of China. Additional funding may have come from the Nigeria Power and Steel Department. The plant was put into operation in 2007. Nigerian former president Obasanjo stated in 2007 that Papalanto, as well as Chinese-financed Omotosho, were generating power for Nigeria's electricity grid in May 2007. The project was expanded, with SEPCO III securing both the original and expansion contracts, and completion was scheduled for June 2010. As part of the deal, the Nigerian Government agreed to pay for Chinese companies to help manage the power plants after construction is completed in two years' time. In 2011, SEPCOâ€™s Project Manager, Mr Li Xianlai, visited the power plant and faulted lack of expertise on the part of the PHCNâ€™s personnel as the reason that only six of the eight turbines were working.

183,China,Bui Dam Complex,2007,FALSE,"As per Brautigam's article and other sources: In 2007 China agreed to finance the 400 MW Bui Dam. The dam was financed by two separately negotiated China Exim bank loans. One was a commercial export buyersâ€™ credit of US$292 million with 12 yearsâ€™ maturity, a grace period of five years and an interest rate set at a margin of 1.075 per cent over the prevailing Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRR). The other, with a fixed interest rate of 2 per cent, appeared to be either a concessional loan or a preferential export credit, for about US$270 million. Development Assistance Committee rules recommend that a mixed credit like this be reported separately: â€˜one for the â€œsoftâ€ loan [ODA] and one for the commercial loan [OOF]. â€˜Tied aidâ€™ like this is allowed under OECD rules for projects that cannot attract commercial financing, although OECD members would be required to report the offer and its terms so that other OECD members could compete on the same terms if they were so inclined (Brautigam 2010). Just like some of China Eximbankâ€™s larger credits in countries such as Angola, the Bui Dam project finance was a resource-secured loan. In this case, it was guaranteed not through oil or minerals, but through export sales of cocoa beans Genertec Corporation of China has a cocoa sales agreement with the Ghana Cocoa Board for up to 40 000 Mt of cocoa beans (30Â 000 main crop; 10 000 light crop) annually over the life of the loanâ€”that is, 20 years. China Eximbank also required Bui Hydropower to have a power purchase agreement with the Electricity Company of Ghana. The net revenue from this will be deposited into an escrow account to help repay the loan. The price for the future electricity was tentatively negotiated to be in a range between US$0.035 and US$0.055 cents kW/h (Habia 2009).",230,Energy Generation and Supply,Electricity; Hydro-generation,Implementation,2,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Ghana,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJI0000020070420e34k00021&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070903e393000wv&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020080904e494001p5&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020080811e48b001gt&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020080926e49q00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020081204e4c4000pg&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://www.docstoc.com/docs/76483699/Mou-for-Project-Loan, Google US, Non-media; http://www.chinapower.com.cn/newsarticle/1105/new1105544.asp, Local Language Source, Donor media or official; http://www.sinohydro.com/664-2227-438511.aspx, Local Language Source, Donor media or official; http://www.pennenergy.com/index/articles/pe-article-tools-template.articles.hrhrw.News.Ghanas_cocoa_to_help_pay_China_for_building_400-MW_Bui.html, Google US, International media report; http://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/upload/Brautigam-Chinese-Aid-in-Africa.pdf",11,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency","Electricity Company of Ghana, State-Owned Company; Genertec Corporation, State-Owned Company; Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod), State-Owned Company; Sinohydro Corporation, State-Owned Company","Genertec Corporation, State-Owned Company; Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency; Sinohydro Corporation, State-Owned Company",3,"Electricity Company of Ghana, State-Owned Company; Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod), State-Owned Company",2,Checked,1,Vague (Official Finance),5,Development,1,Active,1,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJI0000020070420e34k00021&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070903e393000wv&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020080904e494001p5&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020080811e48b001gt&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020080926e49q00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020081204e4c4000pg&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://www.docstoc.com/docs/76483699/Mou-for-Project-Loan, Factiva, Non-media; http://www.chinapower.com.cn/newsarticle/1105/new1105544.asp, Factiva, Donor media or official; http://www.sinohydro.com/664-2227-438511.aspx, Factiva, Donor media or official; http://www.pennenergy.com/index/articles/pe-article-tools-template.articles.hrhrw.News.Ghanas_cocoa_to_help_pay_China_for_building_400-MW_Bui.html, Factiva, International media report; http://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/upload/Brautigam-Chinese-Aid-in-Africa.pdf, Factiva",562000000,USD,0.8379948373,1,670648523.08,,1-Apr-07,,,1,Ghana,452,241,Ghana,GHA,GH,288,652,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,1

Lack of funding has stalled the projectâ€”whose total cost is put at US$1bnâ€”for many years. Attempts were initially made to link the project to various proposals for building alumina refineries, but the relevant investors could not be persuaded to help finance the construction of the dam. Originalyl reported to generate 750 MW, later updates reveal that the Souapiti station would actually generates 515 mW of electricity and would have the potential to supply not only the capital but also many industrial projects, such as the alumina refineries, as well as areas outside Conakry. The US$850m financing is being organized through China's Exim Bank, and two Chinese state-owned construction companies, Sinohydro, as well as China Power Investment Co (CPI) are to build the dam.

195,China,Modernization of the Nigeria railway,2006,FALSE,"(PPIAF) Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) was awarded the contract for the modernization of Nigeria's one-track rail line to standard gauge rail project. The first phase includes part of the 1,313 km railway from Lagos to Kano, the portion from Abuja to Kaduna. The project is worth $8.3 billion USD (which was downsized to $8 billion USD in 2009), and China has loaned the Nigerian government $2.5 billion to finance refurbishment of the railway system. This contract was signed between Nigeria and CCECC on Oct. 30, 2006. The project was originally proposed in 2002 and was to be financed by a $1 billion soft loan from the Export-Import Bank of China. In order to release funding pressures, the project would be implemented in phases.The first phase of the project is a single track railway 186.5 km in length with a contract value of $849,750,903 USD and a construction period of 36 months.The second phase of the project is the Lagos-Ibadan section of the railway, a double-track railway with a total length of 156.8km and a design speed of 150km per hour for both passengers and freight transportation. This portion is worth approximately $1.487 billion USD with a construction period of 36 months. PPIAF-ID:206 However, A Deborah Brautigam China in Africa blogpost from [December 2010 reported that after CCECC won the $8.3 billion contract, the Chinese government had offered a line of export credit for $2 billion at a 'competitive commercial rate,' as well as a preferential export credit at $500 million. These tied credits were considered as potential funding for projects other than the railway, but eventually the $2 billion credit was never used and expired. The $500 million preferential credit was renewed and may be being used to fund a part of the railway infrastructure project. The exact flow type is not known, because Deborah Brautigam referred to the commitment as an export credit, but the Nigerian Federal government was reported as calling it a concessional loan.

810,China,Low medium income housing projects,2006,FALSE,"On November 7, 2006, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki and China Development Bank governor Mr. Chen Yuan met and agreed to sign a framework between the bank and the government of Kenya to expedite the funding of a project for low and medium income housing. The project came in response to Kenya's substantial housing deficit. On December 6, 2006, China Development Bank announced that it would provide a 10 million dollar concessionary loan for the housing project, to be repaid in 15 years. The Development Bank of Kenya plans to provide long-term finance of up to 15 years to low and middle income housing project customers. On May 30, 2008 the ground-breaking ceremony of the housing project occurred. The entire project is expected to last about fifteen years (until 2021) or later, but may last longer due to slow progress accredited to court injuctions and land scarcity. As of 2012, only 2,000 housing units have been completed comared to the 40,000 planned for completion.Implementation of the project's first phase involves the production of 720 housing units for sale and appears to have been successfully completed. As of January 2011, the implementing agencies have concentrated their efforts on Phases 2 and 3. The implementation of the project has so far been carried out by implementing agencies China Wu Yi Corporation Limited and Ederman Properties. Construction efforts in the 'Greatwall Apartments' Complex have successfully provided Kenyan citizens with 528 apartments, as well as facilities including shops and school. Another 105 houses have been constructed as part of the Kileleshwa Park Apartments. Further construction efforts include building 700 housing units in Ngara. 1,000 units in Kibera, 700 units in Madaraka and Nairobi West and 105 units in Lang'ata. The project is linked to the Development Financial Cooperation Framework Agreement (DFCFA) signed by the Kenyan government and the China Development Bank in December 2008. As per the DFCFA, the project will operate in accordance with market principles rather than traditional aid.Funding for the package came as part of a 20 million USD credit for housing, education and health care from the China Development Bank.Contacts who have publicly commented on the project include Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Zhang Ming, general director of the Africa Project Development Team Zhu Qingdong, managing director of the Erdemann Property Limited Yang Zeyun and Housing minister Soita Shitanda. The project may be linked to further low-cost housing projects according to senior comissioner Zhu Qingdong. Qingdong states that the China Development Bank plans to work with the Government of Kenya, Kenya Development Bank, and other financial institutions to support these additional low-cost housing projects.

991,China,Phase 1 of National Rehabilitation Project,2004,FALSE,"(PPIAF) In 2004, China's Export-Import Bank agreed to provide Angola with an oil-backed loan. The funds will repair damaged infrastructure, mainly railway tracks bombed in the country's civil war. The money will also lay roads and electrify slum areas of the capital and also fund rehabilitation of the water supply systems. The total amount of funding available for the first phase of the project is $1 billion USD. The phase involves 27 contracts, including 50 projects of which 21 have been confirmed completed. The projects focus on electricity, water, health, education, public works, each of which will take about 20 percent of the total amount released. As of September 2007, $733.1 million USD had been released, and $1.6 million USD was still available for Phase 1. The Chinese loan is at LIBOR plus 1.5 percent, has a grace period of five years, and a maturity of twelve years; making it most likely non-concessional. PPIAF-ID:9, PPIAF-ID:14, PPIAF-ID:15, PPIAF-ID:17. CONFIRMED: Chinese state company China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), is rebuilding 371 kilometers of the national road linking Kifangondo (Luanda), Caxito (Bengo), UÃ­ge and Negage (UÃ­ge) in Angola. The project, which began in December 2005, is estimated to cost US $211 million. The rebuilding project includes 12 bridges, 10 of which will be new, and requires over 200 aqueducts to be built. The project was expected to be done in June of 2008, but a PPIAF source states that the project was completed on July 25, 2008. CONFIRMED: The No. 1 and No. 2 ring roads (bypasses) of the Angola City (likely to be Luanda - no other Angolan city is large enough to have ring roads) appear to have been assisted by a Chinese commitment of $170 million USD. China's Export-Import Bank and the China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) seem to have some connection to the project.( If this project refers to Luanda ring road, it was constructed by Brazilian contractor Odebrecht according to a Macau newspaper - still has Chinese financing behind it.)

Ltd (KPLC) Jasper Oduorto and Kenyan Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi announced that funding had been secured for Phase 1 of a project to expand Kenyan energy capacity and access to energy. Under the project, the state-owned KPLC would connect 150,000 new power consumers every year. Phase 1 of the project includes plans to establish a 61 km long 132kV line from Chemosit to Kisii, where a sub-station will be constructed, as well as the construction of several power distribution lines. Media sources indicate that China provided a 25 million USD soft loan for Phase 1 and could potentially provide another 35 million USD loan for Phase 2. Later KPLC reports indicate that Phase 1 was financed by 'about 20 million USD' concessional loan from the Exim Bank, and that it began implementation. Phase 2, which may or may not have secured funding, involves construction of a 220kV transmission line from Olkaria geothermal power station near Naivasha to Lessos sub-station. Also proposed under this phase is the establishment of a 132kV transmission line from Rabai sub-station to the tourism hub of the South Coast (note: discrepancy, as another source says a 122-km long, 132kV line will go from Kamburu hydropower substation to Meru). This appears to be connected to project #606, the Olkaria II Geothermal Project. As part of the agreement to fund the project, KPLC agreed to procure materials and equipment from Chinese companies. Reports show that China CAMC exchanged information with KPLC, but do not show whether the China CAMC was involved in the implementation of the project.

1144,China,Third Interest-free Loan for MBC Headquarters,2005,FALSE,"On June 8th, 2001, the Mauritian Cabinet agreed to the signing of an interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY for project financing, with projects to be decided by both sides. Then, in 2004, the Cabinet held a Working Session with a Chinese delegation, resulting in a new interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY and the decision to use these loan funds for the construction of a new headquarters for the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation at EbÃ¨ne. The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company.

Construction of the industrial park began in 2009 and is expected to be completed in 2014. The industrial park will be built on a 2 sq km plot and financed by the China-Africa Development Fund. Qiyuan initiated the idea of building an industrial zone in Ethiopia and the participation of Yonggang, a much larger conglomerate, guaranteed financing so that it won the second MOFCOM bidding in 2007. Later, two additional Zhangjiagang companies, Jianglian and Yangyang Asset Management, joined the project.When completed, up to 80 compaines involved in textiles, leather, and manufacturing construction equipment are expected to invest in the industrial zone, which is intended to help Ethiopia emulate China's patter of accelerated development, according to Trade and Industry Minister Tadesse Haile. The industrial zone is also expected to create 20,000 local jobs. The government reports that it plans to build five more industrial zones throughout the country to attract further foreign investment.Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone was brought in as a technical partner, but not as a shareholder. Because of financial difficulties, however, Yonggang left the project early in 2009 and the smaller company, Qiyuan, has become the major shareholder and executor (Interview, Eastern Industrial Park Management, 2009).Because of the Chinese partnersâ€™ financial difficulties (related to the global economic crisis), the area of the zone has been reduced from 5 to 2 square kilometers (500 to 200 hectares) and the investment from renminbi (RMB) 1 billion (US$146 million) to RMB 690 million (US$101 million). The start-up area is 100 hectares and is expected to cost US$22 million to launch. It currently is under construction, with an expected completion date of 2010. The zone developers still are negotiating with China Eximbank for loan finance (Foreign Trade Information and Survey Newsletter 2009), while CADF is also studying the feasibility of equity participation. Meanwhile, the first project in the zone, the a cement plant, began production in 2010.

1866,China,Shenzhen Energy thermal energy power plant in Ghana,2007,FALSE,"(PPIAF) In 2007, China's Shenzhen Energy Investment Co. Ltd. planned to team up with an Africa development fund set up by the Chinese government to build a 200 mW gas-fired power plant in Ghana. The firm plans to form a venture in Ghana with the China-Africa Development Fund to develop the project, estimated at $137.2 million USD. The project would be installed with two generators currently used at power plants owned by the listed firm and its parent. The 200 mW power plant will be the first phase of a 560 mW project planned in Ghana. In April of 2008, Ghanaian president John Kufuor took part in the ground breaking ceremony at the power station at Kpone near Tema. There is some debate over the actual value of the project; it is possible that the project is actually worth $143 million USD. The project will be conducted by Sunon Asogli Power, the joint venture between Shenzhen (60%) and the Development Fund (40%). The project created controversy when Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), which owned an idle plot of land 300metres away from the land sold to Sunon Asogli Power, built several metres of solid block wall to stop Sunon Asogli Power from gaining access to the construction site. (Shenzen had already spent $50million to prepare the site). Activists protested that VALCO did not have a rightful claim to the idle land, since it was bought from the government in 1952 through compulsory acquisition which forcibly displaced local people. With the vocal support of these local activists, the first phase of the gas project was completed in April 2009. Later, the capacity will be increased to 560 MW. The first phase was completed within 15 months [started August of 2007]. The majority of the engineers, consultants and managers of the project will be Chinese, but it will employ 1,000 Ghanaians. It appears that further construction may have increased the value of the project to $600 million USD in 2009, and in 2012 the partners planned to invest an additional $300 million USD. but it appears that the second phase of the project is still being implemented.

The Ghanaian parliament gave its assent to the agreement in February 2012 under the leadership of the deputy speaker of parliament Honourable Edward Doe Adjaho. This $3 billion USD of loans, which according to government officials, going by the current oil prices, Ghana will be paying $6.4 billion to the Chinese for the $3 billion loan or give away 750 million barrels of the nationâ€™s crude oil to one company for 15 and-a-half years. Recent sources confirm that the amount as of 2012 remained $3 billion USD, but sources disagree on the exact allocation of the loan's funding. Several sources state that China agreed to provide 2.85 billion USD loan to fund a road improvement project.The first phase of this project would begin in early 2011 with an initial investment of $1.9 billion USD, and the second phase would start later in the year. One source says that the loan package's first tranche of $1 billion will be used for two subsidiary agreements on oil and gas and Information and Communications Technology (ICT): specifically, the source states that $850 million has been disbursed for a gas infrastructure development project in the Western Region and $150 million has been disbursed for the development of an ICT platform for surveillance of the oil and gas field. The loan has a five year grace period, 15 years re-payment period, a commitment fee of one per cent flat, an interest rate of 2.95 per cent, six months LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offer Rate), and an upfront fee of 0.25 per cent flat. Another source states that 150 million was disbursed to ICT development or a Western Corridor Infrastructure Renewal Project and $500 million for rehabilitation of the country's western railway line and a further $150 million to be used for the retrofit and rehabilitation of the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority. Another source says that projects to be included under the loan include: the Western Corridor Gas Commercialization project, the establishment of gas-processing plant at Bonyere to use gas discoveries from Jubilee and Sankofa fields for power generation, the construction of gas transmission pipelines from Bonyere to Western, and the Sekondi Free Zone Project. In 2012 officials made plans to change the location of the project from Bonyere to Atuabo. The following are the projects under the $3 billion facility: Western Corridor Infrastructure Renewal Project - Railway Rehabilitation and Modernization Component (Estimated Allocation of $450-500 million), Western Corridor Infrastructure Renewal Project - Takoradi Port Phase 1 Retrofit/Rehabilitation (Estimated Allocation of $150-200 million), 'Sekondi Free Zone' Project (Estimated Amount of $ 100 million), Accra Plains Irrigation Project - Phase 1: 5000 ha.

In 2012, CGC was offering to execute the project at a cost of $575 million US Dollars. If approved, the Chinese Government via its EXIM Bank would provide a facility covering a larger chunk of the money while the Nigerian Government would provide the rest in the form of counterpart funding. Later, media reports stated that FCT Minister, Senator Bala Muhammed had directed a Chinese company, CGC Nigeria Limited, to produce a detailed feasibility for the Greater Abuja Water Project which when completed would result in more than 60% of FCTâ€™s 8,000 square kilometres benefitting from potable water distribution. FCT announced that it would soon embark on the Greater Abuja Water Project through Public Private Partnership with a Chinese company and the World Bank to supply adequate potable water to the entire FCT and the satellite towns. Updates on the project's status are unknown, but news articles indicate that residents of Abuja 'said they were living in a nightmare due to the inability of the FCT Water Board to connect them to public water supply.'

18800,China,Zimbabwe acquires Chinese agricultural support facility,2006,FALSE,"On September 14, 2006, the governments of Zimbabwe and China signed a US$200 million loan agreement to be used for agricultural support and the planned importation of 387,000 tons of Chinese fertilizer for needy Zimbabwean farmers. Agricultural uses for the US$200 million loan include the payment of agricultural equipment, chemicals, and other critical requirements. The shipment of fertilizer is expected to arrive in Zimbabwe at the beginning of October 2006 to help farmers deal with crop shortages. The loan is being facilitated by both the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the Export-Import Bank of China. The Zimbabwean government was represented by Gideon Gono, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, while the fertilizer agreement is a result of a visit to China made by the Vice President of Zimbabwe, Joice Mujuru, and the Zimbabwe Secretary of Economic Development, A. Bvumbe.The first consignment of fertilizer from China arrived into Zimbabwe by December 26, 2012, although the amount of fertilizer was not specified. The fertilizer in question was of Compound Types D, S, C, and L. On February 1, 2007, Samuel Muvuti, acting chief executive of the state-owned Zimbabwe Grain Marketing Board, announced that a second shipment of 13,000 tonnes of fertilizer procured through the US$200 million loan was delivered to Zimbabwe via Mozambique from China with 8,000 tonnes still in transit and 14,000 tonnes awaiting transportation at port in Mozambique with the goal of delivering the fertilizer from the port by mid-February 2007. As of this date, only 57,000 tonnes of the agreed 387,000 had arrived in the country.In 2006, the government of Zimbabwe agreed to mortgage the loan from China using platinum mining concessions from the Selous and Northfields Mines. The mining transactions were to occur through the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and Chinese mining firm Wanbao Mining. However, in a different US$200 million deal with Eximbank, also in 2006, these same mining areas were also up for collateral, causing both deals to stall. On July 11, 2009, Minister Biti signed another memorandum of understanding with the Chinese company Wanbao to free up the mining concessions in Selous and Northfields and allow Wanbao to being mining after the clarification and finalization of legal documentation between the Chinese and the Zimbabwean governments. The terms of the agreement include: the value of the commercial contract should be more than US$2 million.The portion of the Chinese content of exported goods should be no less than 50% of the total value. The cash payment (down payment) made by the importer to the Chinese exporter should not be less than 15% of the total contract value or 20% in the case of ship export contract. The export buyer's credit provided by the Eximbank of China for an export project of goods or services shall not exceed 85% of the total contract value, and 80% in the case of a ship export contract. Additional research into the completion date of the fertilizer delivery was unsuccessful. In 2007, a consignment of 1,000 more tractors and an assortment of other related farming implements worth $100 million USD from China was expected to arrive. The implements include harvesters, irrigation pumps, disc harrows, planters, and electricity generators. As of November of 2011, the facilities were being shipped from China to Zimbabwe. These goods compose the remaining value of the $200 million USD Chinese government loan. It appears that Zimbabwe purchased 97 trucks under the deal, but no financial value for the project was given.

The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

The Zambian project, however, is completely separate from the Zimbabwean expansion. There is some discrepancy as to whether the loan from the Chinese is worth US$250 million or US$400 million. A Zimbabwean debt of US$27 million was holding up the project, but in March of 2013 it was announced that Zimbabwe had paid the debt and that SinoHydro was ready to begin work on the project. There is also a report that procurement regulations had been breached, further postponing the project. Construction has not yet begun. ZESA had previously signed a $670 million agreement with China in 2004 to develop the Kariba South plant.(ID #17449)",230,Energy Generation and Supply,,Pipeline: Commitment,11,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Zimbabwe,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020100426e64q000bv&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=CDENGY0020100628e65300001&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Donor media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020100503e653000up&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=ENR0000020100816e68900004&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.docstoc.com/docs/127898863/sinohydro-projects-worksheet-30may2012, Google US, Non-media; http://www.herald.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60853:govt-bails-out-zesa&catid=41:business&Itemid=133#.UVIPl1vwItU, Google US, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=MEWBUD0020130115e91f0000s&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.hydroworld.com/news/2013/03/07/debt-payment-clears-way-for-kariba-expansion.html, Google US, Donor media or official",8,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency; Infrastructural Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IDBZ)","Sinohydro Corporation, State-Owned Company; Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), State-Owned Company","Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency; Sinohydro Corporation, State-Owned Company",2,"Infrastructural Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IDBZ); Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), State-Owned Company",2,Checked,1,Vague (Official Finance),5,Development,1,Active,1,"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020100426e64q000bv&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=CDENGY0020100628e65300001&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, Donor media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020100503e653000up&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=ENR0000020100816e68900004&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.docstoc.com/docs/127898863/sinohydro-projects-worksheet-30may2012, Factiva, Non-media; http://www.herald.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60853:govt-bails-out-zesa&catid=41:business&Itemid=133#.UVIPl1vwItU, Factiva, Recipient media or official; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=MEWBUD0020130115e91f0000s&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Factiva, International media report; http://www.hydroworld.com/news/2013/03/07/debt-payment-clears-way-for-kariba-expansion.html, Factiva, Donor media or official",250000000,USD,1.0756432121,1,232419074.63,,,,,1,Zimbabwe,552,265,Zimbabwe,ZWE,ZW,716,698,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,No Information,,,,,1

22055,China,China-Zimbabwe sign 144m agreement for rehabilitation of sewers,2011,FALSE,"In 2010, China and Zimbabwe signed a Memorandum of Understanding for financing projects between the two. Officials from the Ministry of Finance, representatives from China's Eximbank and Sinosure signed the agreement. Sinosure was to provide insurance cover for loans for projects supported by the Eximbank. On March 21, 2011 Zimbabwean Vice President Joice Mujuru signed a $144 million USD loan agreement for the development and rehabilitation of water works and sewers in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare. Specifically the funds would rehabilitate, replace, install and commission equipment at Morton Jaffray and Prince Edward Water Treatment plants and Crowborough and Firle Sewage plants. The project would be implemented by China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CNMEC) and funded by the China Eximbank. Some reports also mention the involvement of China Development Bank leaders in negotiations, although the role of the CDB in the project is unclear. Contacts for this project include Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan who attended the loan's signing ceremony, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti, and Mr Li Riougu, the president of the Export-Import Bank of China. Later reports in December 2011 say that the Zimbabwean Cabinet had not yet approved the loan. Controversy arose as to whether the Chinese funding agencies had stipulated that the Zimbabwean local authority would have to pay an 8% interest of over USD $11 million in penalties due to delays in taking up the funds. Separate reports in 2012 and 2013 indicate the Harare City Council is yet to receive the funding, due to the government's failure to pay interest on a 1997 loan advanced to the then Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Industries. Other sources, such as town clerk Tendai Machachi, denied that the Chinese were making such demands. Further information regarding the updated status of this project is unknown.
