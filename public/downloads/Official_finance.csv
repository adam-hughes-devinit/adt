"20104","China","Second Interest-free Loan for MBC Headquarters","2004","false","On June 8th, 2001, the Mauritian Cabinet agreed to the signing of an interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY for project financing, with projects to be decided by both sides.Then, in 2004, the Cabinet held a Working Session with a Chinese delegation, resulting in a new interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY and the decision to use these loan funds for the construction of a new headquarters for the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation at Eb√®ne. The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008. The construction was completed in June of 2010.The other four loans that financed this project are project ID#20881 ID#1144 ID#20089 and ID#21229","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","220","Completion","3","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Mauritius","http://www.panapress.com/Mauritius-gets-$2.3-million-Chinese-loan--13-578166-18-lang2-index.html

The loan was granted by the Export-Import Bank of China, but the trains and locomotives have already been purchased, and TransNamib will deliver the first four machines for $12 million USD each. From a report in 2008, it appears that TransNamib ultimately purchased 17 red Chinese-made locomotives in addition to the four blue ones originally purchased. However, these purchases appear to be a strain on the company because of chronic mechanical problems. The project is likely tied with mineral resources, especially uranium.

The project includes 27 km of trunk sewers, 220 km of secondary and tertiary sewers and about 26,500 additional house connections. This Loan carries a 3% percent annual interest and will be reimbursed in 15 years. In 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China agreed to a soft-loan of 800 million CNY for infrastructure. 220 million CNY of this soft-loan was committed as complementary financing for the Plaines Wilhems Sewer project under the condition that the work was completed by a Chinese contractor. In September of 2009, the Sino-Mauritian Joint Council agreed that the balance of 560 million CNY would go to the Bagatelle Dam project. The financing package offered by the Chinese Government was highly concessionary at 2% fixed rate basis as compared to around  4% prevailing rate.  They further offered a moratorium of 5 years and repayment period  of minimum 10 years negotiable for a longer period.  On January 14, 2008, the International Engineering Department of the Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) agreed to work on this project as a general contractor.

"18800","China","Zimbabwe acquires Chinese agricultural support facility","2006","false","On September 14, 2006, the governments of Zimbabwe and China signed a US$200 million loan agreement to be used for agricultural support and the planned importation of 387,000 tons of Chinese fertilizer for needy Zimbabwean farmers. Agricultural uses for the US$200 million loan include the payment of agricultural equipment, chemicals, and other critical requirements. The shipment of fertilizer is expected to arrive in Zimbabwe at the beginning of October 2006 to help farmers deal with crop shortages. The loan is being facilitated by both the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the Export-Import Bank of China. The Zimbabwean government was represented by Gideon Gono, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, while the fertilizer agreement is a result of a visit to China made by the Vice President of Zimbabwe, Joice Mujuru, and the Zimbabwe Secretary of Economic Development, A. Bvumbe.The first consignment of fertilizer from China arrived into Zimbabwe by December 26, 2012, although the amount of fertilizer was not specified. The fertilizer in question was of Compound Types D, S, C, and L. On  February 1, 2007, Samuel Muvuti, acting chief executive of the state-owned Zimbabwe Grain Marketing Board, announced that a second shipment of 13,000 tonnes of fertilizer procured through the US$200 million loan was delivered to Zimbabwe via Mozambique from China with 8,000 tonnes still in transit and 14,000 tonnes awaiting transportation at port in Mozambique with the goal of delivering the fertilizer from the port by mid-February 2007. As of this date, only 57,000 tonnes of the agreed 387,000 had arrived in the country.In 2006, the government of Zimbabwe agreed to mortgage the loan from China using platinum mining concessions from the Selous and Northfields Mines. The mining transactions were to occur through the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and Chinese mining firm Wanbao Mining. However, in a different US$200 million deal with Eximbank, also in 2006, these same mining areas were also up for collateral, causing both deals to stall. On July 11, 2009, Minister Biti signed another memorandum of understanding with the Chinese company Wanbao to free up the mining concessions in Selous and Northfields and allow Wanbao to being mining after the clarification and finalization of legal documentation between the Chinese and the Zimbabwean governments. The terms of the agreement include: the value of the commercial contract should be more than US$2 million.The portion of the Chinese content of exported goods should be no less than 50% of the total value. The cash payment (down payment) made by the importer to the Chinese exporter should not be less than 15% of the total contract value or 20% in the case of ship export contract. The export buyer's credit provided by the Eximbank of China for an export project of goods or services shall not exceed 85% of the total contract value, and 80% in the case of a ship export contract. Additional research into the completion date of the fertilizer delivery was unsuccessful. In 2007, a consignment of 1,000 more tractors and an assortment of other related farming implements worth $100 million USD from China was expected to arrive. The implements include harvesters, irrigation pumps, disc harrows, planters, and electricity generators. As of November of 2011, the facilities were being shipped from China to Zimbabwe. These goods compose the remaining value of the $200 million USD Chinese government loan.It appears that Zimbabwe may have purchased 97 trucks as part of the deal (ID#19874), but no financial value for the project was given.However, as of July 2012, it does appear that Zimbabwe defaulted on its repayment of the $200 million USD loan.This project is related to ID#19807 and ID#19874.","Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","","310","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Tied","4","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020060928e29s00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

It elaborates that the project is funded through a concessional loan from the China Exim Bank, and implemented by a contract with ZTE Corporation and the Kenyan Directorate of e-government.  Very little information is available about this project, although it does appear to have been completed.

This somewhat conflicts with information that states that phase 2 had two major components. The first component of stage 2, the construction of a new interrnational terminal, was allegedly funded through a $75 million USD mixed loan from China. Reports state that $50 million USD of the project came from a subsidized loan, and the remaining $25 USD million from a loan at commercial rates.  Additionally, reports state that second component of phase 2, the construction of the domestic terminal, cost 75 million dollars funded by China in the form of a low interest loan. The implementing agency that constructed both terminals was the Chinese company AFECC. In November 2010, a ceremony marked the completion of component 1 of Phase 2, the new international passenger terminal of Maputo International Airport. Mozambican president Armando Guebuza and the Minister for Transport and Communications Paulo Zucula attended the ceremony. Work on component 2, the domestic terminal began in April 2011. The construction of the domestic terminal was completed on June 19, 2012 and work was underway on installing its cooling system, electrical appliances, safety equipment, escalators and flight information display system. The domestic terminal is scheduled for inauguration in October 2012. At the time of this announcement the Chinese Bank for Development also announced that it would disburse 80 million USD to construct a new cement plant in Sofala #1221, as well as  20 million USD for the construction of a cotton processing plant in Magude #1223.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","210","Pipeline: Commitment","11","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Mozambique","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020100618e66i001rx&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Sources dispute when the funding of the loan agreement was signed-- one source states that it was signed on September 28, 2010 while another lists December 17, 2010. Finance Minister Sanousse Toure publicly stated that the 250-km  road would run from the capital Bamako to the central town of Segou. The implementing agency is the China Road and Bridge Corporation. A Malian company is also responsible for oversight of the the project, although its name remains unknown. The project was suspended in 2011 due to a coup, but construction resumed on June 22, 2012. According to news reports, Chinese ambassador Cao Zhongming played a key part in resumption of the project.The project has two phases. The first phase of project involves rehabilitation of the existing road, and has secured financing of 73 million XOF. The second phase  of the project involves construction of new road and will cost 86.6 billion CFA francs. It is not clear whether funding for the project's second phase has been secured.

Ltd (KPLC) Jasper Oduorto and Kenyan Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi announced that funding had been secured for Phase 1 of a project to expand Kenyan energy capacity and access to energy. Under the project, the state-owned KPLC would connect 150,000 new power consumers every year. Phase 1 of the project includes plans to establish a 61 km long 132kV line from Chemosit to Kisii, where a sub-station will be constructed, as well as the construction of several power distribution lines .  Press releases reveal that Phase 1 would be financed in part by a $34 million Chinese aid package announced in August, 2005. Later KPLC reports indicate that Phase 1 was financed by a 20,000 USD concessional loan from the Exim Bank, and that it began implementation. Phase 2, which may or may not have secured funding, involves construction of a 220kV transmission line from Olkaria geothermal power station near Naivasha to Lessos sub-station. Also proposed under this phase is the establishment of a 132kV transmission line from Rabai sub-station to the tourism hub of the South Coast  (note: discrepancy, as another source says a 122-km long, 132kV line will go from Kamburu hydropower substation to Meru). This appears to be connected to project #606, the Olkaria II Geothermal Project.As part of the agreement to fund the project, KPLC agreed to procure materials and equipment from Chinese companies. Reports show that China CAMC exchanged information with KPLC, but do not show whether the China CAMC was involved in the implementation of the project. The extent to which Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the project have been completed is also unknown.

"810","China","Low medium income housing projects","2006","false","On November 7, 2006, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki and China Development Bank governor Mr. Chen Yuan  met and agreed to sign a framework between the bank and the government of Kenya to expedite the funding of a project for low and medium income housing. The project came in response to Kenya's substantial housing deficit. On December 6, 2006, China Development Bank announced that it would provide a 10 million dollar concessionary loan for the housing project, to be repaid in 15 years. The Development Bank of Kenya plans to provide long-term finance of up to 15 years to low and middle income housing project customers. On May 30, 2008 the ground-breaking ceremony of the housing project occurred. The entire project is expected to last about fifteen years (until 2021) or later, but may last longer due to slow progress accredited to court injuctions and land scarcity. As of 2012, only 2,000 housing units have been completed comared to the 40,000 planned for completion.Implementation of the project's first phase involves the production of 720 housing units for sale and appears to have been successfully completed. As of January 2011, the implementing agencies have concentrated their efforts on Phases 2 and 3. The implementation of the project has so far been carried out by implementing agencies China Wu Yi Corporation Limited and Ederman Properties. Construction efforts in the 'Greatwall Apartments' Complex have successfully provided Kenyan citizens with 528 apartments, as well as facilities including shops and school. Another 105 houses have been constructed as part of the Kileleshwa Park Apartments.  Further construction efforts include building 700 housing units in Ngara. 1,000 units in Kibera, 700 units in Madaraka and Nairobi West and 105 units in Lang'ata. The project is linked to the Development Financial Cooperation Framework Agreement (DFCFA) signed by the Kenyan government and the China Development Bank in December 2008. As per the DFCFA, the project will operate in accordance with market principles rather than traditional aid.Funding for the package came as part of a 20 million USD credit for housing, education and health care from the China Development Bank.Contacts who have publicly commented on the project include Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Zhang Ming, general director of the Africa Project Development Team Zhu Qingdong, managing director of the Erdemann Property Limited Yang Zeyun and Housing minister Soita Shitanda. The project may be linked to further low-cost housing projects according to senior comissioner Zhu Qingdong. Qingdong states that the China Development Bank plans to work with the Government of Kenya, Kenya Development Bank, and other financial institutions to support these additional low-cost housing projects.

The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

The project includes 27 km of trunk sewers, 220 km of secondary and tertiary sewers and about 26,500 additional house connections. This Loan carries a 3% percent annual interest and will be reimbursed in 15 years. In 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China agreed to a soft-loan of 800 million CNY for infrastructure. 220 million CNY of this soft-loan was committed as complementary financing for the Plaines Wilhems Sewer project under the condition that the work was completed by a Chinese contractor. In September of 2009, the Sino-Mauritian Joint Council agreed that the balance of 560 million CNY would go to the Bagatelle Dam project. The financing package offered by the Chinese Government was highly concessionary at 2% fixed rate basis as compared to around  4% prevailing rate.  They further offered a moratorium of 5 years and repayment period  of minimum 10 years negotiable for a longer period.  On January 14, 2008, the International Engineering Department of the Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) agreed to work on this project as a general contractor.

The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

"54","China","Loan for Rebuilding Infrastructure (Benguela Railway, Luanda Airport, Luanda to U√≠ge Highway)","2005","false","In March/April of 2005, the China International Fund (CIF) and the GRN signed a loan agreement with documents signed in both Hong Kong and Luanda. An initial amount of $2.9 billion US dollars was allocated for the war strewn country and construction projects (taking $2 billion of that money). These projects included reconstructing the Luanda airport and the construction of a new one (US$450 million), expansion and repairs to railway lines such as the Benguela railway line (US$300 million), cleaning the Luanda bay, a new sewage system for the capital, and others. While many of these projects began, in 2007, some had halted due to problems within CIF and the construction company, Beiya International Development Ltd. By the end of 2008, 80 percent of the initial US$2.9 billion disbursement had been spent on these projects. The loan overall was a low interest loan funded with providing Angolan oil. Project list individually:CONFIRMED: China contributed US$300 million in 2006 to begin the refurbishment of the Benguela Railway. Since 2006 sections of the railway have become operational, including the section that runs eastward to Huambo from Lobito, a distance of 423 km. The remainder of the project is expected to be completed in December of 2012. The entire project is expected to cost US$ 1.56 billion, but this funding does not all originate from Chinese sources. China Railway 20 Bureau Group Corp. has been the main contributor to the renovations.CONFIRMED: The new International Luanda Airport, located 30 kilometres from the Angolan capital, is being built by China International Fund Limited. The airport, which will cover an era of 5,000 hectares, will have two double runways. China gave US$ 450 million to the project. Although the project was scheduled to be concluded in 2010, one observer reported in 2011, 'apart from cranes, trucks, Chinese nationals, and a partial foundation, there was little evidence of serious work going on. 'CIF is a company that has no construction record or credentials,' a Chinese official said cynically. 'Largely they are brokers who get contracts from the Angolan government and sell them to other Chinese companies for huge profits.'CONFIRMED: Chinese state company China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), is rebuilding 371 kilometers of the national road linking Kifangondo (Luanda), Caxito (Bengo), U√≠ge and Negage (U√≠ge) in Angola. The project, which began in December 2005, is estimated to cost US$211 million. The rebuilding project includes 12 bridges, 10 of which will be new, and requires over 200 aqueducts to be built. The project was expected to be done in June of 2008, but a PPIAF source states that the project was completed on July 25, 2008.CONFIRMED: The new bridge over the River Cunene, in Xangongo, Angola, built by the subsidiary of the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is complete as of June 2009. The bridge, estimated to cost US$29 million, is 808 metres long and 11.64 metres wide and was built over two years and five months. The work was audited by Africon Gabenk BKS. The road between Ondjiva and Xangongo, covering 108 kilometers, was also built by CRBC for US$47 million and was completed as of June 2009.CONFIRMED: Around US$100 million dollars of the China credit line will be spent in the rehabilitation and equipping of various health posts in the central Huambo Province announced by Angolan Health minister Sebastiao Veloso in August of 2005. The mentioned sum will be used in the rehabilitation and equipping of the regional hospital, located in Huambo city and in the construction of two district hospitals.STAFF_NOTES:This project could benefit from splitting.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","210","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Tied","4","Angola","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020050517e15h0004j&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

These machine form part of a total of 1,400 units to be procured with the loan. The current status and end date are unknown.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","210","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Uganda","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020101103e6b200008&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"120","China","PPIAF - Accra-Kumasi trunk road rehabilitation","2003","false","(PPIAF) In 2003, China agreed to sponsor the reconstruction of the Ofankor-Nsawam dual carriage-way. The Chinese vice minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Wenchang and President John Agyekum Kufuor signed the agreement. In April of 2006, the Ofankor-Nsawam dual carriage-way was completed at opened to vehicular traffic after two years of construction. Work started in June of 2004 under an interest-free loan agreement worth $28 million USD between Ghana and China. The terms of the loan were that it would be repaid in annual installments by the Ghanaian government over a period of ten years from November of 2012 to October of 2022 with export commodities of Ghana or convertible currencies to be agreed upong by the two governments. The road, 17.4 km in length, has no restrictions to vehicular traffic. The road is part of the Accra-Kumasi trunk road rehabilitation project. The contracting firm for the project is China Railway Engineering Corporation. The project includes the construction of a 20 meter fly-over bridge over the rail line near Ofankor.

The study, which began in July 2007, took twelve months to complete and was undertaken by the First Survey Design Institute of the Peoples Republic of China, and was sponsored by the Chinese government. The initiative was a follow up call by the Chinese government's pledge that it made to the Ghana government in 2004, to improve the country's rail sector. The Eastern rail line according to the Minister requires about $1.5 - $3.4 billion USD for the successful rehabilitation of existing rail lines and the construction of new lines from Kumasi to Paga, in the Upper East Region. He said, the government in collaboration with some investors was trying to raise $100 million USD for the commencement of the Eastern rail line project. As of May 2012, the Ghanaian government is sourcing $990 million USD from the Investment and Commercial Bank of China for the railway rehabilitation.

Ltd. to construct a new power station in Zambia. The project is expected to begin in 2006. Zesco public relations manager Monica Chisela was present. The station will be upgraded from 900mW to 990 mW to accomodate a growing demand for electricity in Zambia. It is unclear exactly when the project commenced, but the upgrade has been completed. It appears untied, however. The project is also related to the Iranian Export Development Bank providing 85 percent of the financing for the $120 million Itezhi-Tezhi power station project in Zambia.

The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008. The construction was completed in June of 2010.The other four loans that financed this project are project ID#20881 ID#20104 ID#1144 and ID#20089","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","220","Completion","3","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Mauritius","http://dspace.cigilibrary.org/jspui/bitstream/123456789/32406/1/MauritiusInvestmentRelations.pdf?1

"450","China","Sicomines Barter Deal","2007","false","In September 17, 2007, China and the DRC signed an agreement for an $8.5-9 billion loan given from the Exim Bank of China, involving two $3 billion infrastructure credits and $3 billion in investments in mines located in the Mashamba basin, the Dima basin, the Dik Colline D syncline, and Kolwezi. The IMF then put pressure on the Chinese to reduce the size of the loan, and the second $3 billion infrastructure credit has since been dropped through a renegotiation of the contract. Although the project was originally owned 25% by Sinohydro corp., 43% by China Railway Engineering corp., and 32% by Gecamines, the China Railway Engineering Corp's investment is currently resting on an appeal to the China's National People's Congress Standing Committee. The Congolese Infrastructure Minister Pierre Lumbi reported that $3 billion will be spent on infrastructure, including 2,000 miles of railway between Sakania and Matadi, a 2,000-mile road linking Kisanganiand and Kasumbalesa, a motorway between Lubumbashi and Kasumbalesa, 31 hospitals, 145 health centers, two international-standard universities, and 5,000 government housing units. The motorway between Lubumbashi and Kasumbalesa was completed by the CREC from March-November 2008, totaling 72 km of road. The transportation projects were planned to be completed within 36 months. Some sources report that a lot of the promised infrastructure has already been built, but there has yet to be any major mining due to the massive controversy facing this project. The initial deal promised to provide China with copper and cobalt over the next 25 years.","Multisector","Infrastructure, Education, Health","430","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Partially tied","3","Congo, Dem.

He said, work would begin on a multi-million dollar project that involves the construction of a railway line, through the Shai Hills, to link the ports of Tema and Akosombo. He explained that goods and containers bound for the northern part of Ghana and other land locked countries, would be transport from the Tema Port via train to Akosombo and ferried along the Volta River to Yeji, for further transportation to their intended destinations by land. In October 2010, John Atta Mills, Ghanaian President, inaugurated the train service worth $23 million USD on the rail network. Construction on the project commenced in December of 2004, rehabilitating the existing Tema - Accra - Nsawam suburban railway, and constructing new lines and bridges. The first phase of the Accra-Tema line (Accra to Asoprochonaa) was inaugurated in December 2007. The government financed phase one with a loan of $5m, $500,000 from matching funds and $2.58m from the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) funds. OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) granted a loan of $5m in 2005 for the project also. In 2007, the government awarded a design, build, operate and transfer contract to Peatrack for expansion, reconstruction and operation of a rail network between Accra-Tema and Paga. The project has a concessionary period of 35 years. It is unclear what the exact total for the project was, but it does not appear that it was bilateral.

The ambassador said China Hydro and other energy companies are interested in rehabilitating the plant, which was badly damaged and neglected during the country‚Äôs long civil war from 1989 to 2003. Mount Coffee provided 64 MW pre-war, but it is estimated that a revamped plant could generate as much as 1,000 MW from the fast-flowing St Paul River. Both the ambassador and minister emphasised the importance of exploiting Liberia‚Äôs vast hydroelectric power potential for attracting major investment. Current capacity is a meagre 23 MW, meaning that businesses of all sizes are almost completely dependent on costly generators.Significance: The exploitation of Mount Coffee is absolutely crucial to Liberia‚Äôs future, but the high capital cost means the government needs a joint venture. Earlier discussions with Brazilian mining giant Vale have not been productive, but China has the funding, expertise and track record to carry out the project (see Liberia: 14 April 2011: ). Like so many countries in Africa, Liberia is increasingly looking to China to fund and build major infrastructural projects, such as roads, bridges and power plants, while in the last five years it has also provided over 200 scholarships and 1,000 training opportunities for students and professionals. In return, China will be expecting the usual access to minerals as Liberia finally starts to access its vast reserves of iron ore.

The total project cost appears to be $622 million USD. This sum includes a concessional loan for $270 million USD between the two governments while there was another agreement worth $292 million USD between Ghana and the Export-Import Bank of China. Ghana will contribute $22 million USD to the construction of the facility. In September of 2008, President John Agyekum Kufour launched the construction of the dam, which is expected to be completed in five years. It is currently under construction, according to International Rivers. The project appears to be tied to cocoa resources. Ghana's state-run cocoa market regulator Cocobod was to supply cocoa directly to China as part of the deal.

Additionally, the terms include a moratorium of 5 years and a repayment period of 10 years negotiable for a longer period.  In September 2009, it was decided at the 8th Sino-Mauritian joint council that 580 million CNY of this project would be used for the Bagatelle Dam project under the condition that a Chinese company be contracted for the work. The Chinese side put forward China International Water   Electrical Corporation (CIWEC) as their preferred contractor. The dam crosses over the Terre Rouge River. On May 22, 2012, CIWEC completed construction on a cement mixing plant necessary for the construction of the dam. The source reported that this plant's completion indicated the main works on the dam would begin soon.

Guangdong Xinguang International Group planned to invest in three stages of the project, and $2 billion was made available by the Nigerian government to commence the projects. The Export-Import Bank of China funded $1 billion of the project. But the project, initially scheduled for completion in 2013, became financially troubled. In September 2012 it was revealed that new financing terms had been reached in Beijing: $US 500m over 20 years financed by China's Export-Import Bank. Though the World Bank's Building Bridges reported that Guangdong Xinguang International Group would be working on the project, it now appears that China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation is implementing the project.

In addition to the port, rail and road corridor (partially funded by the Chinese), the project also entails the creation of a separately funded pipeline to export oil.On May 2, 2012 Kenya launched the project's construction. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and South Sudanese President Salva Kiir attended the launch ceremony. The effort forms part of the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) Project.  In addition to the Chinese grant, funding for the 24.5 billion USD LAPSSET project also comes from the World Bank, African Development Bank and African Union.

"289","China","Memve'ele Dam","2003","false","In 2003, China announced that it would grant Cameroon 30 billion CFA francs to help build three hydoelectric dams. To that regard, Cameroon's President Paul Biya signed a financial agreement between the China International Water and Electrical Corporation and the Cameroon mining, water and energy ministry. The first of the dams to begin implementation, the Memve'ele Dam in Nyabizan, will cost a combined FCFA 420 billion. The project is jointly financed by Eximbank China through a FCFA 243 billion loan solely for the construction of the dam and FCFA 112 billion from the African Development Bank for the putting in place of other components of the project. The rest is made available by the government of Cameroon. The implementing agency for the project is Sinohydro Corporation Limited. When completed, the Hydroelectric Dam project will have a dam, headrace channel, intake tower, secondary dam, living camp for contractors, homogeneous earth dam, power house, tail race tunnel, and tail race outlet and is expected to inject 201 MW of electricity into Cameroon's energy supply network. The implementation of the project was officially launched by Cameroonian President Paul Biya on June 15, 2012. The dam is expected to become operational by 2017. At the time of the launch, the Cameroonian President reiterated that two more dams projects are in store.

Construction of the industrial park began in 2009 and is expected to be completed in 2014. The industrial park will be built on a 2 sq km plot and financed by the China-Africa Development Fund. Qiyuan initiated the idea of building an industrial zone in Ethiopia and the participation of Yonggang, a much larger conglomerate, guaranteed financing so that it won the second MOFCOM bidding in 2007. Later, two additional Zhangjiagang companies, Jianglian and Yangyang Asset Management, joined the project.When completed, up to 80 compaines involved in textiles, leather, and manufacturing construction equipment are expected to invest in the industrial zone, which is intended to help Ethiopia emulate China's patter of accelerated development, according to Trade and Industry Minister Tadesse Haile. The industrial zone is also expected to create 20,000 local jobs. The government reports that it plans to build five more industrial zones throughout the country to attract further foreign investment.Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone was brought in as a technical partner, but not as a shareholder. Because of financial difficulties, however, Yonggang left the project early in 2009 and the smaller company, Qiyuan, has become the major shareholder and executor (Interview, Eastern Industrial Park Management, 2009).Because of the Chinese partners‚Äô financial difficulties (related to the global economic crisis), the area of the zone has been reduced from 5 to 2 square kilometers (500 to 200 hectares) and the investment from renminbi (RMB) 1 billion (US$146 million) to RMB 690 million (US$101 million). The start-up area is 100 hectares and is expected to cost US$22 million to launch. It currently is under construction, with an expected completion date of 2010. The zone developers still are negotiating with China Eximbank for loan finance (Foreign Trade Information and Survey Newsletter 2009), while CADF is also studying the feasibility of equity participation. Meanwhile, the first project in the zone, the a cement plant, began production in 2010.

He also pledged to allow additional Ethiopian agricultural projects to China duty free (Project #12635). On Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's trip to Beijing in April 2011, Ethiopian Finance and Economic Development Minister Sofian Ahmed signed the loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China for 15 pre-determined development projects, including the Amarti Nashe Hydroelectric Power plant (#1057) and the expansion work of the Mugur Cement Factory.On September 24, 2007, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $208 million loan agreement to finance the expansion of the Muger Cement Enterprise and the construction of Fincha Amerti Neshe multi-purpose projects, including hydo-power generation and irrigation. The agreement was signed by the CBE President Abie Sano and Export-Import Bank of China President Li Ruogu. The Ethiopian government will cover the remaining $68 million of the project's $276 million total cost.The Muger Cement Enterprise expansion project began on April 21, 2012. Construction was delayed for more than two years for several reasons, including the 24 month delay of the EX-IM Bank of China loan, power interruptions, and logistical problems while transporting construction materials from Djibouti port.

A bilateral agreement covering the 20-year concessional loan, to be repaid at 2.5% interest,  was signed during a visit to Gabon by the Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, according to the Gabon government.  On October 18, 2010 an overhaul of the Libreville power grid began. The project involves the design of the new power grid, equipment supply, and construction. Overall, three new substations will be built on top of the expansion of four existing ones. Three new overhead transmission lines and two underground cable transmission lines will also be added. The first part of the project began on October 21 when the management workers came to the work site to start the renovation process. The project should take 2 years to complete. The Chinese have loaned Gabon the money through a $130 million US dollar loan for 20 years with 2.5% annual interest. The construction faced difficulties in acquiring adequate lands from private property, and it was thus delayed for actual construction until 2012. The status of the grid is uncertain.STAFF_NOTES:The following text is translated from a Chinese source. It is uncertain if the referenced project is related:(The project involves the construction of three new power transmission stations, four substations, three overhead transmission lines, and two underground cable transmission lines.  The Endu Mu station is of the 225/90kV class, while the other transmission stations are of the 90/20kV variety.  The transmission lines are of 90kV capacity and the overhead cable is 103km long, while the underground cable is 27km long.

The fiber optic network will cover the whole country providing more durable and efficient common bandwidth for all communication service providers. Under the project, all regional capitals and 36 major towns would be linked by fiber optics to enhance rural telephone and internet services. The fiber optics will be linked with Kumasi and further to the north, subsequently connecting Accra. The first phase of the project, upgrading the existing fiber optic network and expanding the communications network in the southern loop, is expected to be completed in January of 2008, and the second phase, the expansion of the network to parts of northern Ghana, is expected to be completed by the end of 2008. Ghanaian Minister of Communications Albert Kan Dapaah and VP of China's Eximbank met to agree on the deal. Deputy Minister of Communication in Ghana Dr. Benjamin Aggrey Ntim was also familiar with the project. According to reports, the construction of the project started in 2006 by Chinese company Huawei Technologies, while Eximbank made available $31 million USD towards the project.

"149","China","PPIAF - Ghana Telecom equipment supply, Phase 1","2003","false","(PPIAF) In 2003, Ghana Telecom and Alcatel Shanghai Bell signed a $150 million USD contract to provide 650,000 telephone lines, introduce broadband services, centralize a billing system, process and improve the quality of GT's services over the following three years. Ghanaian Minister of Communications Albert Kan Dapaah, Chinese ambassador to Ghana Lu Yonjshou, CEO of GT Oystein Bjorge, and Chairman of Alcatel Shanghai Bell Yuan Xin are all familiar with the project. In December 2003, the project was suspended because of a lawsuit against GT by Malaysian G-Gom. According to reports in 2005, the project was continued with the installation of 250 radio antenna to serve about 400,000 mobile phone users. 60 Chinese engineers are participating in the project. It is still unclear if the project was completed, but it appears to be untied. There appears to be some discrepancy between the amounts, reports include $67 million USD and $79 million USD, but it is unclear exactly how the money was designated.Phase 1 of the project appears to have been completed with the help of 60 Chinese engineers. Sources confirmed that Phase 2 was beginning in 2005.(PPIAF) In 2005, Ghana Telecom signed a buyer credit agreement with Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Bank (SG CIB) worth $67 million USD. The agreement carries a maturity of 6 years. Funds will be used to upgrade and expand Ghana Telecom's networks, financing the import of equipment from Alcatel Shanghai Bell. The loan is insured by Sinosure, the Chinese export credit agency.  Phase 2 of Ghana telecom project includes the supply of fixed network exchanges, mobile network equipment, and optical transfer equipment. Sinosure prevented default on this deal, after receiving preliminary notice of potential default in February 2007. There is some confusion that this might be a 50-50 Chinese-French joint venture. The total cost for Phase 2 appears to be $80 million USD, and the Chinese will commit $67 million USD.

The third phase consists of a new treated water pumping station as well as a pressure transmission (mains) system from Kpong to Accra through Oyibi to terminate at Okponglo [suburb of Accra] out in the five-year plan.(PPIAF) In 2010, the Chinese government agreed to provide Ghana with preferential buyer's credit worth $260 million USD for the execution of the Kpong Water Expansion Supply Project to help boost water delivery systems in the country. The facility has a grace period of five years, repayment duration of 15 years, maturity period of 20 years, interest rate of 2 percent per annum, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum, a management fee of 1 percent flat, and a grant element of 37.08 percent. The total project cost is $273 million, with the remaining $13 million USD provided by the Ghanaian government. The project when completed, would increase water supply from Kpong Head Works to Accra and Tema to improve the reliability of potable water delivery to domestic, commercial and industrial customers. The project is expected to be completed in 2014. As of July 2012, the project was 30 percent complete.

Lack of funding has stalled the project‚Äîwhose total cost is put at US$1bn‚Äîfor many years. Attempts were initially made to link the project to various proposals for building alumina refineries, but the relevant investors could not be persuaded to help finance the construction of the dam. The proposed Souapiti station would potentially generate 515 mW of electricity and would have the potential to supply not only the capital but also many industrial projects, such as the alumina refineries, as well as areas outside Conakry. The US$850m financing is being organized through China's Exim Bank, and a Chinese state-owned construction company, Sinohydro, is to build the dam. The dam will likely be linked to the Kaleta and Amaria mines. It is unclear what the current status of the project is, but it appears that the project is still under consideration.STAFF_NOTES:International rivers spreadsheet confirmed that this was distinct from #13823, confirmed the wattage at 515 mw, and confirmed that it's still in pipeline.

Guinean company Conakry promises in return to deliver bauxite and gold to China for three years before granting it mining concessions. Rice will be imported via Guinea Golden SA and sold by Sireca, a company run by Mamadou Sir√© Bah which for the moment has no mining activity. The Compagnie des Bauxites de Kindia (CBK), a subsidiary of RusAl, will be supplying the bauxite. The rice donations are part of a larger $21 billion parcel of aid promised by China, through projects like the construction of hydraulic dams in the Konkour√© river basin, in exchange for a portfolio of mining permits. 

The managing director of RusAl, Anatoly Pantchenko, is familiar with the project. It is unclear if the project has been carried out or what its current status is. It appears that the actual agreement may be worth substantially less than the original $21 billion.","Multisector","food aid, mining","430","Pipeline: Pledge","12","In-kind contribution","Tied","4","Guinea","http://www.africa-asia-confidential.com/article-preview/id/22/Dam-payment

Originally, the February 15, 2000 agreement was for equipment worth only US$366 million, but the value shot up to the government-approved level of US$420 million in the final tender. Additional research into start and finish dates for the delivery of the equipment to the Chinese company was unsuccessful. However, a 2012 media report from the Zimbabwean paper, the Financial Gazette, indicates that construction on the Msthabezi pipeline has yet to even begin in Zimbabwe, suggesting this project probably remains incomplete.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","pipeline","140","Pipeline: Pledge","12","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=afnws00020021107dw6g019gx&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The deal dates back to events starting in 2006. It involved the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and a Chinese company, Wanbao Mining, for the development of platinum in a concession known as Selous and Northfields reserves covering 110 square kilometres. ZMDC represented the Zimbabwean government and Wanbao the Chinese.  However, when Zimbabwe in 2006 negotiated a US$200 million facility with Eximbank, the Selous and Northfields reserves were put up as collateral. This left the concession encumbered and the mining deal was stalled for a while. Biti has now signed the MoU to extricate the concession and allow for the mining upon finalisation of 'legal documentation and declaration of the obligations of the Chinese'. The Chinese development assistance has been in the form of concessional loans, export credit (including buyer's and seller's credit) and grants. Zimbabwe has benefited from a buyer's credit loan from China. In August 2006, China extended a US$200 million buyer's credit loan facility to Zimbabwe for the procurement of fertilisers, agrochemicals, agriculture equipment and tools, irrigation and other equipment and animal health products. The terms of the agreement include: the value of the commercial contract should be more than US$2 million.The portion of the Chinese content of exported goods should be no less than 50% of the total value. The cash payment (down payment) made by the importer to the Chinese exporter should not be less than 15% of the total contract value or 20% in the case of ship export contract. The export buyer's credit provided by the Eximbank of China for an export project of goods or services shall not exceed 85% of the total contract value, and 80% in the case of a ship export contract. Biti has been trying to sort this issue out in relation to the platinum deal.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","320","Pipeline: Pledge","12","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Tied","4","Zimbabwe","http://zimbabwenewsonline.com/top_news/117.html
