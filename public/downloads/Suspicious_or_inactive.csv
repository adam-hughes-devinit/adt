''我们公司顺利完成了在南非博茨瓦纳的一个总承包项目，并且赢利可观。很难想象，这个项目前期规划并不完善，执政党出于下届选举需要，项目立项、决策阶段均比较仓促。建成时却赢得了业主、政府及社会各界的一致赞誉，这不能不说是个奇迹。管好分包有妙招——聘用外方协调人我们2003年1月与博茨瓦纳卫生部签订了马哈拉佩医院设计—施工总承包合同。合同总金额为4300万美元，合同工期为35个月；医院占地面积约15万平方米，总建筑面积49666平方米。马哈拉佩医院是一个大型综合性医院，涉及的专业非常广泛，指定分包的工作量占合同额的40%，在该项目中的主要指定专业分包有电气及医用器材分包、机械分包、电梯分包、发电机分包及锅炉分包等，承担这些分包工程的分包商均是综合型跨国公司，拥有丰富的国际工程管理经验，其技术力量雄厚。我公司作为马哈拉佩医院项目的总承包商，在统筹管理项目的同时，专门聘请了一名项目管理经验丰富的外籍员工担任该项目的协调人，协调各分包商的工作，监督工程质量和进度，同时还聘用了一名经验丰富的南非老估算师，负责项目的管理、对外交往及索赔工作。实践证明，上述人员在中方人员的指挥管理下，不仅解决了在语言交流上的困难，还增强了公司的对外实力。项目实施过程中，管理协调好各方之间的关系，对于全面实施合同、加快进度、提高工程质量起着举足轻重的作用。在马哈拉佩医院项目进行过程中，我们坚持每月召开两次总包与咨询工程师、总包与分包之间的协调会，会上主要解决每一阶段项目实施过程中存在的问题，处理项目信息，并协调有关各方的工作。现场材料供应——提前订货质优价廉材料管理工作是加快项目进度、降低项目成本的重要环节，材料供应又是保证项目能否顺利进行的关键。由于马哈拉佩医院项目设计所使用的大部分材料需要从南非、欧洲进口，而当地产品的生产种类和规模又有一定的局限性，因此提前订货就显得非常重要。加之该医院项目是浮动标，订货采购程序较为复杂。为了降低项目成本，我们在确保材料质量和供货周期的情况下，货比三家，选择质优、价实、供货周期短的供货商与其签订供货合同。在控制材料计划、材料质量、材料价格和供货周期这些材料管理工作关键程序的同时，明确材料人员的职责范围，制定出分阶段材料供货到场的计划安排，定期召开材料方面的协调会，确保生产所需材料、构件、设备等及时供应。抓紧索赔——FIDIC成护身符　　马哈拉佩医院项目在签订合同时是浮动标，因此索赔工作就显得尤为重要。尽管材料报价、购买、索赔工作程序繁琐，但它关系到整个项目的经济效益，所以我们将其作为工程索赔工作中的一项重要环节来抓。材料索赔是按照购买时的材料价与投标时的基价比较进行索赔的，因此在材料报价、购买、索赔时我们严格依据FIDIC条款和该项目估价师的要求，对该项目的所有材料在订货前向业主方估价师提供报价。　　该项目严格遵守FIDIC条款，条款对时间的要求很严格(承包商的索赔必须在28天内发出)，因此，各种索赔资料准备得是否及时、详细、有理有据是索赔能否成功的关键。由于我们吃透FIDIC条款，索赔工作进展得有序有效，公司获得了可观的经济效益。大胆本地化——迅速赢得市场　　在境外实施工程总承包项目，走属地化经营管理之路，是成功实施项目的关键，是扩大当地市场占有量的必由之路。属地化经营管理的实质就是要实行属地化策略，要在经营管理的各个层面按照项目所在国的规章、制度和运作方式规范操作流程。人才属地化是实现属地化管理的一项重要内容，要充分利用当地的人力资源，充分发挥他们在语言、文化、社会关系、沟通协调上的优势，甚至有些重要的项目管理岗位都可以大胆地起用当地人才。　　我公司1989年4月在博茨瓦纳注册，目前当地雇员已经超过1500人，分布在办事处总部、各项目经理部和施工现场各个层面。属地化经营使我们拿到了马哈拉佩医院的总承包项目，并通过该项目的成功实施，进一步提升了我公司在当地的知名度，使我公司在当地占领了一定的市场份额，成为当地主要承包商之一。　　我们公司在从国内选派有经验的优秀项目管理人员的同时，着手搞好当地劳动力资源的收集和管理，建立当地分包商及工人档案，从中选取以前合作过且表现较好的分包商，以及经验丰富、技术较熟练的工人。该项目提供给当地人才的工作岗位比较全面，包括项目管理人员、秘书、文员、估算师、工长、技术工种及普通劳力，该项目在实施高峰期中方人员约8 0人，当地工人超过1000人。'","Health","","","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Botswana","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LQAF000020041210e0c80003v&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Rwanda will receive half the amount as a grant and the remaining 50 million yuan as a five-year interest free loan, said Gao Hucheng, Chinese Deputy Commerce Minister and international trade representative.Chinese firms are increasingly making strategic entries into Kigali, targeting mainly infrastructure projects. China will send an expert group to Rwanda for a feasibility study of a 25km road construction project in the capital city of Kigali, financed by the Chinese government. Chinese engineers are also expected to construct a new ultra-modern clinic in Masaka, a suburb of Kigali.Kigali for its part is sending a delegation to China, led by Prime Minister Bernard Makuza as it seeks to attract investment from the world's second largest economy.'We are beginning to see requests from China after a visit last year. We have another trip planned for November and this is to try to attract more Chinese investors into Rwanda,' John Gara, the chief executive officer of the Rwanda Development Board, the institution charged with promoting investment in the country, told The EastAfrican last week. 'China is also one of the few countries where RDB has an office (in Shenzhen) and it has proved useful,' he saidA July 2011 International Monetary Fund report on Rwanda shows foreign direct investments decline from $118.7 million in 2009 to $42.3 million last year.RDB is targeting at least $500 million in new investments both local and foreign in 2011. 'In the past, we have been promoting Rwanda in a more general way, but now, we are not only targeting certain companies, but also targeting projects,' Mr Gara said.While Asian investment is steadily rising in the country with the RDB registering 20 companies from the region within a period of six months this year with an estimated value of $16.5 million, Chinese investment is still relatively low compared with India. Between January and July this year, Indian investments were estimated at $9.2 million, mainly in agro-processing, manufacturing and administrative and support service sectors, while Chinese projects amounted to $5 million, mainly in tourism, construction and manufacturing sectors.'The figures for Chinese FDI are not yet as high as we would want them to be, but certainly we are beginning to see interest,' Mr Gara observed.Chinese ambassador to Rwanda Shu Zhan said while the country has registered tremendous progress in improving its business environment, including setting up a One-Stop Centre for registration, the 'paperwork' is just one aspect of the whole investment environment needed to attract investment.'The regional situation, especially the uncertain stability of the Great Lakes Region, also affects on the confidence of investors. Rwanda still has room to improve the investment environment, for example, by offering tax breaks,' he said.Trade between the two countries doubled to $76.4 million in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year.'There are various areas of interest such as telecoms, mining and engineering. More than 100 such entrepreneurs have already visited Rwanda to get a better understanding of the environment,' he said.According to Standard Bank Group Ltd, Chinese investment in Africa may grow by 70 per cent to $570 billion by 2015 from 2009, while blateral trade will double to $300 billion by 2015. Chinese firms, led by state-owned China National Offshore Company (CNOOC) are some of the major players in the oil exploration business in East Africa.

"1979","China","Rwandatel, Huawei in $35m Deal (Not a Project)","2008","false","19 February 2008 03:15 AMAll Africa AFNWS English (c) 2008 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Kigali, Feb 19, 2008 (East African Business Week/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Rwandatel, a landline telephony and Internet Service Provider has signed a US$35million deal with Huawei Technologies based in China to expand network in Rwanda. According to a press release from Rwandatel the deal signed last week in Kigali will facilitate a nationwide rollout of new infrastructure that will support Rwandatel's Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) and 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System(UMTS) network services. Rwandatel's partnership agreement with Huawei Technologies, a private high-tech enterprise and a global leader in providing next generation telecommunications networks, based in Shenzhen city, South China, seeks to help Rwandatel revamp its landline network and replace its Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) with a New Generation Network (NGN) to attain a strong network. The deal is expected to accelerate Rwandatel's GSM to cover most of the inhabited areas and roads with the 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) covering most of the urban centres in Rwanda. Huawei Technologies is the largest telecom vendor in China's telecom market and have already won trust from over 300 telecom carriers around the world. Its products and solutions serve over 90 countries, as well as 22 of the world's top 50 operators. In 2004, its contracted sales reached US$5.58 billion, an increase of 45% year on year. In the same year, the company's international sales hit $2.28billion. Huawei Technologies now operates worldwide with 55 branch offices in nine regions worldwide. It has set up several research institutes in Dallas and Silicon Networks Valley in USA, Bangalore in India, and Stockholm in Sweden, Moscow in Russia as well as Beijing and Shanghai in China. The signing of this deal comes two months after the acquisition of Rwandatel by LAP Green Networks, a subsidiary of the Libyan African Portfolio (LAP), an arm of the Libyan Government. LAP Green Networks specializes in acquiring and managing networks across Africa and is currently present in over five countries and expanding. LAP Green Networks now owns 80% shares in Rwandatel while the remaining 20% stake belongs to Social Security Fund of Rwanda (SSFR). LAP Green acquired 80% stake in Rwandatel by paying $100illion and promised to invest other $300m in fifteen years in the national telecommunication set up. During the signing agreement, LAP Green pledged to spend $87m in its first year of operations in Rwanda. Rwandatel, a formerly state owned telecom company that was founded in 1993, had in 2005 been privatised to Terracom Communications, an American IT provider on the cost of $20million equivalent to 99% stake. Terracom Communications was owned by Mr. Greg Wyler. The deal went sour with government accusing Terracon of failing to deliver its commitments. The government of Rwanda later in 2007 bought back Rwandatel from Terracom Communications and sold it to LapGreen Networks to revamp the sector. 'The contract between Rwandatel and Huawei is only the first amongst many to come,' the release reads in part, adding that in the following weeks, Rwandatel, will be signing contracts worth over $40million.

"312","China","2 Schools in Douala","2007","false","'The president of China, Hu Jintao, pledged nearly $100 million in grants and soft loans to Cameroon on Wednesday as he kicked off his latest tour of Africa, a growing supplier of oil and raw materials to his country. China has been offering low interest loans, debt relief and other incentives to increase its influence on the world's poorest continent in return for access to the natural resources it needs to feed its booming economy. 'China and Africa have developed mutually respectful and beneficial relations over the years,' Hu said at a banquet thrown by President Paul Biya of Cameroon, in a speech broadcast on state television and radio. 'China and Africa have never tried to impose their social and economic development models on others,' Hu added. Hu, who also toured Africa last year, met Biya to discuss social aid programs for clean drinking water and cheap housing, as well as a greater role for China in the local oil industry and other resource sectors.'Through you, I invite Chinese companies to come and invest in Cameroon, especially in hydrocarbons such as gas and oil, mineral exploitation and forestry, where numerous opportunities exist,' Biya said at a working session with Hu.Hu, the first Chinese head of state to visit Cameroon, was greeted by singing, dancing and flag-waving children. Citing the World Bank, Biya told Hu that since receiving debt relief under the so-called Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, Cameroon had become 'one of the best risks in Africa.'Hu arrived in Cameroon late Tuesday on the first leg of an eight- country tour that will also take him to Liberia, Sudan, Namibia, South Africa, Seychelles, Zambia and Mozambique.Hu and his group, which includes the minister of commerce, Bo Xilai, the foreign minister Li Zhaoxing and other senior policy makers, signed eight accords with Cameroon. Those deals included a 40 million yuan, or $5.15 million, grant and 30 million yuan interest-free loan for economic and technical cooperation, as well as two concessionary loans of 350 million yuan each, one for telecommunications projects. Hu also canceled Cameroon's debt to China - whose value was not specified - and signed agreements to build two schools and a hospital in Cameroon's commercial capital, Douala.China's trade with Cameroon, which has reserves of oil, bauxite and iron ore, doubled to $338 million in the first 11 months of 2006.At a special China-Africa summit in Beijing in November, Hu offered $5 billion in loans and credit to Africa and pledged to double aid, keen to demonstrate that China's ties with Africa went beyond thirst for its oil and raw materials.Trade between China and Africa jumped 40 percent to $55.5 billion in 2006, with the balance of trade $2.1 billion in Africa's favor, according to Chinese Trade Ministry data published this week by Xinhua, the official press agency.'Many African nations cannot look to the U.S. or Europe as models for development because they are simply too advanced,' said Hu Biliang, a senior economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government research group based in Beijing. 'China is a developing nation and ideologically similar,' the economist added. 'Oil and energy trade offer China and Africa a mutual opportunity to gain through trade, but more importantly China offers many African states an example of development, a road to follow.'But some Africans have warned that poor African countries may ultimately lose from expanding trade with China unless they carefully examine bilateral deals and protect their weak manufacturing sectors from inexpensive Chinese clothes and household goods. This means Hu may face a more guarded reception than in the past.Some Western leaders and analysts have criticized China for offering trade, aid and investment with no strings attached, saying it undermines efforts by Western donors to promote democracy and human rights through conditional aid.Hu's trip will also take him to Sudan, where civil war in the Darfur region has killed an estimated 200,000 people and forced 2.5 million more from their homes in violence that Washington has labeled as genocide. China has resisted sanctions and other pressure on Sudan, from which it buys crude oil, saying they will not help to solve the conflict in Darfur. But it said Wednesday that it would support a joint UN-African Union peacekeeping mission to Darfur.Document INHT000020070201e32100023''　据喀麦隆《论坛报》30日报道，喀麦隆政府将拨款240亿非洲法郎（约合5200万美元），帮助西北省“杀人湖”尼奥斯湖移民安居乐业和进一步治理“杀人湖”。　　该报援引喀麦隆西北省省长库帕·伊萨的讲话称，这笔资金将主要用于建设尼奥斯湖的毒气检测和排放系统以及移民迁入地区的水电供应系统和医疗卫生设施。　　伊萨说，喀麦隆政府“决定投入240亿非洲法郎，其中80亿非洲法郎已到位”。　　1986年8月21日夜，超量的二氧化碳气体突然从尼奥斯湖中喷出，掀起80多米高的水浪。随着闷雷般的轰响声，这股强大的气体在湖区周围迅速扩散和蔓延，仅半小时就使沿湖1746名居民和6000多头牲畜窒息死亡。　　尼奥斯湖为火山湖，海拔1091米，长2500米，宽1500米，平均水深200米，湖中存积着巨量二氧化碳和二氧化硫等有害气体，如遇地震或地层变化，便可能发生剧烈的喷发或爆炸。距离该湖不远的莫努恩湖于1984年8月15日也曾喷发过毒气，夺去数百人的生命。（记者陆遥）''新华网雅温得1月31日电（记者 钱彤 陆遥） 正在对喀麦隆进行国事访问的国家主席胡锦涛1月31日在雅温得同喀麦隆总统比亚举行会谈。双方就中喀关系、中非关系和其他共同关心的重大问题交换了意见，达成重要共识，一致同意共同努力，推动中喀友好合作关系和中非新型战略伙伴关系深入发展。    胡锦涛表示，建交36年来，中喀两国人民的传统友谊不断加深，两国友好合作关系稳定健康发展，取得了丰硕的成果。政治交往和合作有力地增强了双方政治互信，成为中喀友好合作关系的基础；多种形式的经贸合作不断深化，成为双方加强合作的优先领域；社会人文合作增进了两国人民的相互了解和友谊，成为双方深化合作的重要方面。喀麦隆政府坚定奉行一个中国政策，在台湾、人权等问题上给予中方宝贵支持，中方对此深表赞赏。    胡锦涛指出，实践证明，中喀友好合作关系有力促进了双方发展进步，符合两国和两国人民的根本利益。胡锦涛结合落实中非合作论坛北京峰会成果，就发展中喀关系提出建议：一、增强政治互信和合作，加强各层次往来和交流，在涉及各自利益的重大问题上继续相互支持和帮助。二、拓展互利双赢的经贸合作，确保在建合作项目按期保质完成，发挥经济互补优势，重点加强农业、初级产品加工、基础设施、能源、电信等领域的互利合作。三、密切社会人文领域的交流合作，加强教育、卫生、文化、体育、旅游等社会人文领域的交流，鼓励两国妇女、青年组织扩大交往。四、加强多边领域的协调和配合，在重大国际和地区问题上保持沟通和协调，维护发展中国家正当权益，共同推动建设持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐世界。 ''中国援建喀麦隆吉德和楠加-埃博科两所小学校交接证书由中国驻喀麦隆大使黄长庆与喀基础教育部部长尤素福？阿蒂加？阿丽姆（YOUSSOUF Née HADIDJA ALIM）分别代表中喀双方于2009年12月23日在雅温得签署。　　两所小学校是根据2007年1月31日中国与喀麦隆政府换文规定，分别由沈阳国际经济技术合作公司和重庆国际经济技术合作公司承建的项目，先后在2009年内通过双方验收，具备了交付条件。 ' ","Education","","110","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Cameroon","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070131e31v00148&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"448","China","Preferential Loan Agreement (Duplicate)","2008","false","'KINSHASA, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi Tuesday made a one-day visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) aimed at enhancing mutual understanding and expanding cooperation. He held talks with President Joseph Kabila who hailed China for providing valuable support and aid to his country at a critical time of peace and reconstruction, which demonstrated the genuine friendship between the two countries and their people. The DRC is located in central Africa, with an area of 2,345,410 square km. As of July 2005, it has a population of around 60 million. Years of war dramatically reduced national output and government revenue. Conditions improved in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. Since August last year, government forces have been battling rebels in provinces of North and South Kivu. In talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao in March 2005, visiting DRC President Kabila called China a dependable friend of the DRC. China officially recognized the Congolese government shortly after it declared independence from Belgium on June 30, 1960. In February, 1961, China and the then Republic of Congo established diplomatic relations. Since No. 19, 1972 when the two countries issued a joint communique on bilateral relations, China and the DRC have maintained exchanges of high-level visits. In November 2006, along with other African countries, the DRC signed a declaration on the establishment of a new strategic partnership between China and Africa during Beijing Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. The DRC was the second leg of Yang's four-nation tour to Africa, which includes the other three countries of South Africa, Burundi and Ethiopia. The visiting Chinese foreign minister said that 'China and the DRC are good friends and good partners. The two countries have been constantly supporting each other on the basis of mutual understandings in issues related with national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Kabila reiterated his government's adherence to the one-China policy, saying the DRC government attaches great importance to its relations with China. The DRC and China share common views on many issues of significance, and the potential for bilateral cooperation is huge, Kabila said, expressing his willingness to ensure a smooth bilateral cooperation in fields like trade and investment. The Chinese minister said China appreciates the DRC government's adherence to the one-China policy, and firmly supports the DRC's efforts in consolidating peace, promoting national reconciliation and realizing economic development. He said that China would further strengthen bilateral cooperation in fields like economics and trade, and implement related cooperation projects, in order to benefit the Congolese people and push the bilateral relations to a new high. Yang also held talks with his DRC counterpart Antipas Mbusa Nyamwisi, state minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, during which the two sides hailed the bilateral relations, agreed to promote mutual understanding and friendship, and enhance political dialogue, under the framework of which the two countries can exchanges views on bilateral, regional and international issues. Nyamwisi also briefed the Chinese FM on the security situation in eastern DRC and on the progress of the on-going conference on peace, security and development in eastern provinces of North and South Kivu. They also signed a preferential loan agreement worth 33.6 million U.S. dollars, to be financed by the Export-Import Bank of China, for the construction of a national fiber optic trunk in the DRC. The project will be undertaken by China International Telecommunication Construction Corporation. The two ministers consented to further implement the assistance measures announced at Beijing Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in November last year, and expand cooperation in fields like trade, infrastructure construction, culture, education, health and human resources. Trade between the two countries in the January-November period last year grew by 26.8 percent over the same period of the previous year, totaling 490 million U.S. dollars, according to statistics from China's Ministry of Commerce.

"541","China","Cement Factory (Not a project)","2006","false","BEIJING -- Egypt expects China to supplant the U.S. as its top trading partner within five to six years, a shift that reflects China's growing influence in Africa and the Middle East.'Traditionally, Egypt was always looking west,' to the U.S. and Europe, said Egypt's minister of trade and industry, Rachid Mohamed Rachid, in an interview.As Egyptians buy increasing quantities of Chinese goods, and China's hunger for energy and raw materials draws it closer to the Middle East and Africa, Egypt is putting greater focus on its Asian relationships.Mr. Rachid is in Beijing this week on his first official visit, just weeks before a major summit will bring many of Africa's top leaders here. He said Egypt is working to secure as much as $2 billion in Chinese investment as it seeks to take advantage of China's expanding interests in the resource-rich region.As part of China's drive in the Middle East and Africa, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Egypt in June. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is scheduled to come to Beijing in November. An economic and trade relationship that is expanding quickly -- albeit from a small base -- is expected to top his agenda.Mr. Rachid said Egypt's total trade with China is likely to reach $5 billion by 2010, from just more than $1 billion in 2005. 'It's nothing to do with politics. It's only because China is able to offer cheaper and better products than everybody else,' he said. Mr. Rachid dismissed the possibility that stronger trade ties with China would affect the U.S.'s influence in the region. The U.S. provides Egypt, a critical Mideast ally, with billions of dollars in military and other aid. 'The U.S. will, of course, continue to be a very important strategic and economic partner with Egypt,' he said. 'It's not either-or.'Skeptics in the U.S. worry that China's growing stake in the region could lead Beijing into conflict with Washington's agenda. Already, China has opposed U.S. plans to bring United Nations' peacekeepers to war-torn Sudan, one of the top sources of China's oil, and Beijing is resisting calls for stronger sanctions against Iran, another major supplier of energy.China now dominates the trade relationship with Egypt, having sold $915 million in goods to Egypt in 2005. Mr. Rachid says the gap is likely to persist. Thus, he is trying to bring some balance to the broader economic relationship by bringing in Chinese investment, promoting Egypt's proximity to markets in southern Europe and Africa and its network of free-trade agreements.Deals agreed upon during Mr. Rachid's trip include a $500 million convention center to be built by a Chinese construction company outside Cairo and the building of a $120 million cement factory that will use Chinese technology. Another plan under discussion with Chinese conglomerate Citic Group is the building of a $100 million aluminum plant in Egypt.Mr. Rachid said Egypt also has created a dedicated industrial park, called the Suez Economic Zone, that will be run by a Chinese company and will specialize in attracting other Chinese corporations to invest.Document WSJE000020060907e29700009'","Manufacturing and Industry","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Egypt","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WSJE000020060907e29700009&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved.Speaking at the “Prospects of Sino-Egyptian Corporation on Oil,” Abd El Aleem Taha, chairman of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corp, said that Egypt will seek to continue to develop energy projects with China.“The cooperation between Egypt and China is very important,” he said. He placed special emphasis on the importance the relationship held for Egypt’s job market, as well as technology exchanges.Taha expects the countries to work together on exploring and refinery projects, as well as oil rig manufacturing.Egypt’s first oil rig, Mubarak-1, was built earlier this year by an Egyptian-Chinese factor.In July 2005, the Tharwa Petroleum of Egypt and China’s Sinopec created Sinotharwa Drilling Company, an $18 million joint venture providing oil and gas drilling in Egypt and other parts of Africa and the Middle East.Additionally, the two countries have cooperated on Egyptian Petroleum HH Rig Manufacturing Shareholder Company.Earlier last week, Reuters reported that Zhiming Zhao, executive president of Sinopec, said China intends to increase its oil and gas imports from Africa by 10% in the next five to 10 years. Egypt, Equitorial Guinea, the Sudan, and Nigeria were specifically mentioned by Zhao as countries China wanted to continue to work with in importing oil.Currently, China imports roughly 30% of its total oil imports from Africa and has invested approximately $30 billion in the continent’s oil and gas infrastructure. – Frank NietoDocument HFTM000020080417e43o0002w'","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Egypt","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=HFTM000020080417e43o0002w&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"729","China","Upgrade of telephone system (Duplicate) ","2006","false","ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP)--Three Chinese firms will invest $1.5 billion over the next four years to upgrade Ethiopia's telephone system, officials said Thursday. Huawei Technologies Co., China International Telecommunication Construction Corp. and ZTE Corp., plan to expand the network as part of one of the largest financial investments ever made in the impoverished Horn of Africa nation, officials said. The companies were from among eight international bidders, among them Ericsson, Nokia and Siemens. The firms aim to boost mobile phone users from the current 1.5 million customers to 7 million. Fixed lines will be quadrupled from 1 million to 4 million users. The project represents a huge investment in Ethiopia where annual incomes are just $100 and annual gross domestic product just $8 billion. The country frequently suffers severe food shortages and is unable to feed its 77 million people without foreign aid. 'It should be a significant improvement in our country's telecom system,' said Abdurahim Ahmed, spokesman of the Ethiopian Ministry of Telecommunications. 'It will even deliver services to very remote areas and expanding on already existing services in the urban centers, along with improvements in the mobile network system.' The Ethiopian government was seeking others to invest an extra $900 million needed to completely overhaul the telecommunications infrastructure, he said. Chinese officials weren't immediately available for comment. China is eager to expand relations with Africa, offering aid, trade and investment deals to gain access to markets and oil supplies. Bilateral trade between China and Africa has more than tripled since 2000 and now exceeds $40 billion a year.

The African country is looking for significant investment in its hydrocarbons sector and in August 2006 decided diplomatically to recognise China over Taiwan (see Chad: 9 August 2006:). Significance: China is responsible for building up Sudan's oil industry from a low level and after this first visit by a senior government minister from the East Asian giant, Chad can also expect huge investment in its oil sector.Because of China's special relationship with Sudan, hostilities between Chad and Sudan should cease permanently. Chad's oil is currently exported by pipeline via Cameroon, but with Chinese funds it is possible that a new pipeline will be constructed and Chad's crude could be exported from Sudan's east coat. Meanwhile, Li's visit to Equatorial Guinea saw his host's bilateral debt to China reduced by US$75 million. Global Insight believes China will take significant acreage in Equatorial Guinea's upcoming licensing round due early this year; the country's oil sector is currently dominated by U.S. firms. When Li completes his seven nation tour he will also have visited Guinea Bissau, Botswana, Eritrea, Central African Republic and Benin. ''中国外长李肇星已抵达乍得并与乍得总统伊特诺举行了会晤。双方就乍得邻国苏丹受战乱摧残的达尔富尔地区的人道主义危机等事项进行了磋商。这是李肇星此次非洲七国访问的第四站。李肇星此行的主要目的是加深中国与非洲各国的关系，同时李肇星此行也反映出中国对非洲大陆日益增加的经济兴趣。李肇星还签署了一系列协议，包括中国向乍得提供价值两千六百万美元的优惠贷款及免除乍得欠中国的数十亿美元债务等内容。此前，李肇星刚刚结束对中西非国家几内亚比绍的访问，几内亚比绍获得了中国四百万美元的捐助。中国迫切希望打通渠道获得非洲大陆丰富的石油与矿产资源，用来满足国内经济高速发展的需要。因此中国和苏丹与津巴布韦等因侵犯人权而遭到西方国家摈弃的非洲国家发展关系的做法也饱受西方国家的批评。' ","Debt Relief","","600","Pipeline/identification","1","Debt forgiveness","Unset","","Chad","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020070105e31500019&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"757","China","Not a project: Revival of tram project NEEDS CONFIRMATION","2011","false","In 2011, a media source reported that the China International Fund Ltd was planning to revive the tram project in Antananarivo.Chinese companies have gone on the offensive in Madagascar, where the Minister for Finance, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, has just informed the President for Transition, Andry Rajoelina known as TGV, about the project to create the Madagascar Development Corporation (MDC), a joint venture between the Malagasy State (15%) and the China International Fund Ltd (CIF). A company based in Hong Kong and related to China Sonangol (an alliance between Chinese capital and the Angolan State), CIF is particularly planning to revie the tram project in Antananarivo (ION 1297). The financial configuration of this future MDC is similar to that of the Société Sino-Guinéennede Déeloppement which the CIF tried to found in Conakry (Guinea) at the end of 2009 when the country was under the thumb of President Moussa Dadis Camara. The sponsors of this Guinean company are the very same that are now trying to promote Sino-Angolan interests to TGV: the former Guinean Minister for Mines, Mahmoud Thiam, a close friend of his Malagasy opposite number, Mamy Ratovomalala, and the International Football Federation (FIFA) player agent Amadou Diaby. These two men went to Antananarivo several times, where they were received by TGV and his advisors. According to Africa Energy Intelligence (sister publication to The Indian Ocean Newsletter), China-Sonangol is planning, via their intermediary, to recover the oil search permits that the Malagasy State is trying to revoke from Madagascar Oil.Thiam and Diaby also took a Frenchman along with them: Gilles Wertheimer, a businessman who may already have participated in building a military hospital in Guinea with Chinese funding. Via his company Alliance International Partners, whose Africa representative is Diaby, Wertheimer offered TGV to build several pre-fabricated hospitals, thereby enabling him to keep promises he had made during the campaign for the constitutional referendum last year. Wertheimer estimates that this construction work could be financed by levying $10 million on the amount paid by the Chinese company Wisco to obtain its contract to work iron ore at Soalala.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Madagascar","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=IOLET00020110204e71m0000s&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

A meeting scheduled next week in Geneva with all its main donors will be a make-or-break moment for the country - its chance to secure reliable funding to underpin an overdue economic recovery.The meeting has repeatedly been put back because of domestic political events. The last time a Guinea-Bissau government managed to obtain a package of donor pledges was in 1999, in the aftermath of destructive civil conflict. An agreement was then made with the International Monetary Fund, but it fell through in 2001 because of slippages in the government's engagements.An emergency post-conflict deal was expected at the end of last year. But then came another setback - the unexpected decision by newly-elected President Joao Bernardo 'Nino' Vieira to sack the government. The donors' meeting was postponed once more.Guinea-Bissau, one of a dozen countries in the world that have stayed in the World Bank's category of fragile states for the last four years, is back to the same point it was at just over a year ago. The International Monetary Fund is ready to give the go-ahead for its special post-conflict assistance. This will be a signal for other aid, starting with $10m of budget support which the government has already negotiated with the World Bank.Oer the past few years, European and regional partners have had to come to the rescue with exceptional one-off help to meet essential needs such as paying wage bills and purchasing fuel. Guinea-Bissau has not always been able to make use of assistance available, especially when aid agencies or non-governmental organisations require matching local funds for their projects.In irregular fashion, the country has been receiving about $50m a year from multilateral and bilateral sources. It is now looking at least to double this flow.The government's poverty reduction strategy sets out financing needs over the next three years of $441m, covering mainly capital spending programmes. Just under 20 per cent is already accounted for, leaving a funding gap of $354m. This is without counting the cost of reforming the armed forces and police, which will also require donor money.International officials expect there to be broad support for the programme at the Geneva meeting, but the level of new funding remains uncertain. The government, they say, has set its financial targets high, and some parts of the programme may run beyond the three-year time frame.Prospects for a sharp increase in backing are pegged to the government's blueprint for military reform, which is designed to renew donors' confidence about the political outlook, and the economic policy framework presented in the latest annual budget.'We are fairly confident that the international community is sensitive to our programme,' says Issufo Sanha, economy minister.If the meeting is a success, it will be seen as a significant step towards normalisation.Oer the years, the country has suffered from donor fatigue as former supporters became disenchanted. The government is hoping to recover their backing, especially for the security sector. Among the main donors, the World Bank has projects devoted to HIV/Aids and other health issues, a broad infrastructure programme and rehabilitation of the private sector. The African Development Bank has stepped up its involvement with projects of $8m each in agriculture and new mooring facilities for fishing boats.The European Commission has concentrated mainly on infrastructure, with the emphasis moving from roads to energy. France and Portugal are the only EU countries with embassies in Bissau, the former focusing on health and governance and the latter also involved in education and capacity-building. As part of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, Brazil is also playing an increasing role.Alongside this aid, Guinea-Bissau has been receiving significant assistance from China, following a breach in relations between 1990 and 1998, when the country dealt with Taiwan instead. The Chinese have big interests in fishing and are seen as potential partners for oil. Aid projects have included the renovation and staffing of a hospital at Canchungo in the north-west. In the capital, a prominent new parliament building, completed last year, stands as a conspicuous symbol of China's support. Ministers say the Chinese are now also helping to provide military housing and are due to deliver new government offices.At a time when western partners are seeking a co-ordinated approach and exerting pressure for more rigorous economic management, the country's arrangements with China are the subject of some speculation.President Joao Bernardo Vieira says the government sees relations with China as complementary to western donors, arguing that 'countries such as China and Brazil have technologies adapted to our level of development'.

"849","China","Manganese deal- duplicate with 851","2009","false","ABIDJAN (Dow Jones)--Iory Coast state mining company, Sodemi signed a partnership agreement Wednesday with China National Geological   Mining Corp., or CGM, to develop a state manganese ore mine in the southwest.According to the director-general of Sodemi, Jean Likane-Yagui, the partnership with CGM will boost production at the Lauzoua site from the current 150,000 to 200,000 metric tons to 300,000 tons by 2011, and 500,000 tons by 2013.'China represents our main market for manganese ore at the moment, so it was only logical to work with a Chinese mining company,' said Likane-Yagui.Sodemi says the site has certified reserves of 1.4 million tons.The partnership deal gives 51% to Sodemi, 39% to CGM and 10% to the state.The agreement will also see the construction of a ferromanganese factory at the site with an initial capacity of 50,000 tons per year, with the possibility of an extension to 165,000 tons.'This signature shows the interest international investors have in our country as we leave behind the years of civil war. Iory Coast is open to all investors to exploit the riches of our mineral reserves,' said Minister of Mines and Energy Leon Monnet.Trade with China has more than doubled, from 50 billion CFA francs, or $112.6 million, to 112 billion CFA francs in 2008.Chinese companies are particularly active in transport and construction, with various building projects including a new presidential palace in the capital Yamoussoukro and a new hospital in President Laurent Gbagbo's hometown, Gagnoa.The other main manganese mine is in the northeast at Bondoukou and run by the Indian firm Taurian.So far this year, Iory Coast has exported 74,822 metric tons of manganese ore, down 32,176 tons, or 30%, from the 106,998 tons shipped up to this point last year, according to official port data.Iory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer, but the minerals and hydrocarbons sector is increasingly important.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Cote D'Ivoire","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJCS000020090923e59n000ac&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Lila Ratsifandriamanana, minister of foreign affairs of Madagascar, said for years China has helped the African nation with projects involving sugar, medicare, agriculture and housing.She also said Madagascar and other African countries are grateful for China's move to cut their foreign debt. Sama Siama Banya, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation in Sierra Leone, said his country has been servicing external debt at the cost of developing the economy.After wars and conflicts, he said, Sierra Leone urgently needs capital for economic recovery, and is delighted at China's debt-relief endeavour.China established diplomatic ties with Sierra Leone in 1971. Since then, Banya said, China has never imposed its will on Sierra Leone.Bonaya Godana, Kenyan minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, said external debt has been a heavy burden on Africa. Many countries spend 30 per cent of their revenue repaying debt, thus affecting the development of education, medicare and social welfare.He said Kenya hopes the international community, especially developed countries, make more commitments to alleviating the debt of Africa.Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, minister of state for foreign relations of Cameroon, said slave trade and colonialism has put Africa in a disadvantageous position. He noted that the average yearly income of people in sub-Saharan countries is only 500 US dollars per capita.With rising debt, trade deficit and decrease of international assistance, African countries risk being marginalized during the course of economic globalization, he said.He said China has been providing huge aid to African countries, and Africa sincerely thanks China for doing this. Andre Bumaya, minister of foreign affairs of Rwanda, said China has always sided with African countries regardless of changes in international politics.Bumaya said Rwanda is thankful to China, and that the forum has injected new vitality into China-Africa relations.

Analysts expect it to reach $30 billion by 2006. >>China currently has 84 companies operating in Madagascar, according to government statistics. >>Chinese companies control over two-thirds of the tax-free textiles export business, the island's biggest foreign exchange earner, and also are players in Madagascar's road construction programme. >>France and the United States are Madagascar's two largest trading partners. >>Huang said Chinese investment in Madagascar was currently running at $40 million, but would probably increase. >>The Chinese government would continue to donate development aid, beyond existing projects in road construction, and the building of sugar and pharmaceutical factories and a sports stadium, he added. >>Last month, Hong Kong tycoon Hui Chi Ming's Gahood Holdings bought the bankrupt Malagasy Banking Company and revied it with new capital as the International bank of China-Madagascar. >>Madagascar is negotiating an offshore oil exploration concession with China's National Petroleum Corporation. Though largely unexplored, the island is thought to have big oil and mineral reserves. >>Madagascar remains impoverished and three-quarters of the island's 17 million people live on less than $1 a day. >","Unset","","","Completion","3","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Madagascar","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020051123e1bn000xb&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

'This shows that more and more countries attach importance to the Protocol, which is the first international legal instrument to address this issue of humanitarian concern. Now, almost all major land mine producing and using countries have acceded to the protocol.'However, Sha said, 58 states are too few. 'Lack of universality will undercut the protocol's significance,' he stressed. 'And no matter how perfect an international legal instrument is, its influence and effectiveness will be limited in the absence of universal participation.'He urged the states to follow the Protocol in earnest.Sha announced that the Chinese delegation is strongly opposed to any proposal for further amending the protocol at the current stage.However, he said, states may, on a voluntary basis, take the lead in implementing technical specifications as outlined in the proposed amendments and provide gratuitous technical assistance, equipment and training to developing countries.On humanitarian de-mining, Sha said that the Chinese government is continuing to cooperate with the Mine Action Service of the United Nations Department of Peace-Keeping Operations by co-sponsoring another training workshop on de-mining technology from May to June this year, with trainees from Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Rwanda.The Chinese government is pressing rapidly ahead with its donations of de-mining equipment to Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Namibia, he added.'We hope this conference will strengthen exchanges and cooperation on de-mining technologies for reducing and ultimately doing away with land mines Sha said.He emphasized that the Chinese government stands ready to cooperate and exchange with interested countries and inter-organizations in the field of humanitarian de-mining assistance and that China is also willing to join other states and explore ways to streamline the de-mining process.Document xnews00020010818dwcc01d3t","Humanitarian and Disaster Relief and Preparation","","","Completion","3","Scholarships/training in the donor country","Partially tied","3","Africa, regional, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda","http://global.factiva.http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=xnews00020010818dwcc01d3t&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

He said Xianyi has been a mover in development due to his devotion and willingness to succeed, adding his absence would be felt by majority of the citizens as his presence made a great difference.Ambassador Xianyi said Lesotho has great potential for development, not only on its natural resources being the clean abundant water, beautiful climate and scenery, but also in Lesotho citizens who are the greatest assets that Lesotho possesses.He indicated that Basotho would treasure the stable political situation and make joint efforts to create a bright future. He mentioned that last year when famine hit in Lesotho, the Chinese government extended their hands to assist, adding that when China was stricken by natural disasters, the Chinese people always received quick consolation and sympathy from Lesotho.However, he noted that since the Prime Minister's visit to China, the cooperation between the two countries has stepped into fast track in various fields like education, health, culture, industry, environment, and military training.He mentioned that about 30 Lesotho citizens are being trained in China, while there are scores of Chinese medical doctors, teachers and construction aid workers working in Lesotho.Xianyi also mentioned that in the field of project cooperation, the Chinese government sponsored Butha Buthe Industrial park that has just been completed and the National Library and Archives. He indicated that Chinese government has been encouraging financially strong Chinese businessmen to come to Lesotho for diversified investment in various fields, concluding that there was a promising future business exchange between Lesotho and China.by Tepiso MncinaCopyright Mopheme/The Survior.

All Rights Reserved The Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) has reported that the Chinese National Petroleum Company (CNPC) has signed an agreement with the Mauritanian government to acquire two exploration blocks in the country. The report states that the CNPC has acquired Block 12 and two areas in Block 13. CNPC has committed to conduct exploration in the two concessions for a three-year period (extendable to six). If commercial quantities of oil are found, the CNPC will be granted a 25-year production license (renewable twice), with the Mauritanian government acquiring a 25% stake each time the license is renewed. Significance: Woodside's success in Mauritania, where the company now plans to develop new production, has increased the country's oil and gas profile. A number of smaller oil companies have been interested in acquiring new acreage in the wake of Woodside's discovery, but as yet there is no real consensus as to just how prospective the country is. The CNPC has sought to obtain interests in regions where the oil majors do not operate.

The irrigation systems include one for the commercial and research grapes and others for 20 settler plots. The construction of this infrastructure was made possible under a loan agreement between the two governments. Speaking at the ceremony, President Sam Nujoma said that the loan agreement was made possible by the continued excellent working relationship and cooperation between the two countries. Nujoma said that initially the Namibian government requested a loan from the Chinese counterparts for the construction of a pump station, a main pipeline and a reservoir. However, when this project was completed in February 1996 the two governments extended the loan to include a second phase that ended with the handing over of the houses and the irrigation systems. According to Nujoma, the objective of the project is to supplement national and household food security and to promote agricultural development in the country. The country also needs to earn foreign exchange and generate economic growth, he stressed. He said that a number of farmers from the previously disadvantaged groups will be trained and settled at Aussenkehr to make use of the facilities... Meanwhile, Chinese ambassador to Namibia Chen Laiyuan said that China attaches great importance to the continued development of the bilateral relations between the two countries. 'In the spirit of the Beijing Forum on China and Africa Cooperation, China is ready to explore together with Namibia, new ways and areas for further cooperation,' he noted. China has already undertaken several projects in Namibia. These include a day-care centre for children in Katutura, drilling and installation of 30 boreholes in the Omusati and Caprivi regions. Low cost housing projects in Windhoek, Gobabis and Katima Mulilo and the Northern Tannery and Leather Project in Ondangwa are some of the other projects the Chinese will be involved with...

China even invited the five African states that still recognise Taiwan (Malawi, Cape Verde, Swaziland, Gabon and Sao Tome and Principe), but it seems that none of them accepted the invitation.During the summit, the Chinese government is expected to announce an ambitious aid and trade package for the next three years.Aailable statistics show that trade between China and Africa grew at an average of 30 per cent a year between 2000 and 2005. Between January and September 2006, this trade reached 40.56 billion US dollars, and it is expected to exceed 50 billion dollars by the end of the year.This expansion is impressive, when one bears in mind that ten years ago trade between China and Africa was only one billion dollars a year.Projections in the Chinese press are that both China and its African partners want to see trade double (to about 100 billion dollars a year) within the next three years.China has facilitated this trade by exempting from tariffs more than 190 products exported by African countries. The results of this measure are clear: in the first six months of this year African countries exported to China 51 per cent more than they did in the same period in 2005, reaching 14.6 billion dollars.Trade the other way, from China to Africa, only increased by 30 per cent, reaching 11 billion dollars.Speaking to the Mozambican journalists who are in Beijing for the summit, Foreign Minister Alcinda Abreu dismissed as worthless allegations from some western quarters that China's real intention is to grab African resources.Cynics could say whatever they liked, but nobody would stop the cooperation A further area of cooperation is education, with China intending to increase the number of scholarships it offers for African students. By 2008, China should be providing around 4,000 university places for Africans. Mozambique will be among the countries to benefit. Currently there are only 36 Mozambican students studying in Chinese universities.

You also concluded successful political, cultural, social and economic cooperation,' he noted.Changchun indicated that both parties share the same vision - to improve the living standards of the people and to foster peace and stability in both countries.He informed Nujoma that equipment and cash (to the tune of about 500,000 Namibian dollars) have been donated to the SWAPO-Party during an earlier visit by the delegation at the party's headquarters.The delegation met with SWAPO-Party Secretary-General and Minister Without Portfolio Ngarikutuke Tjiriange as well as other party members.Changchun informed Nujoma that the meeting included new ideas to foster partnership between the two political parties.Follow-up meetings will follow in due course, he said.Changchun indicated that the Mining Industry is one of China's priorities in Namibia.A wide range of cooperation between the two countries amongst others will include Information Communications Technology, power supply and a railway equipment purchase project.The delegation is expected to leave this Sunday [20 November].Source: Nampa news agency website, Windhoek, in English 17 No 05 //LUSAKA, No. 25 (Xinhua) -- Power demand in southern Africa will exceed the current installed capacity in 2007/8 thanks to the steady economic growth in the region which entails additional demand for electricity, according to a recent power report.Rhodnie Sisala, vice president of the Union of Producers, Transporters and Distributors of Electric Power in Africa (UPDEA) which is holding its 37th general assembly in Lusaka on November 24-25, said an additional 1,500 MW was needed each year upon the current capacity of 45,000 MW to cater for the increasing demand for electricity.Most of the activities in the electricity sector over the last year have concentrated on the action plans required to ensure that supply of electrical energy will not be a constraint to development in the southern African region.And the UPDEA southern African region utilities have been involved in various activities aimed at addressing the projected power deficit in 2007, increasing access to electricity and promoting regional integration.Earlier in 2002, the executive committee of the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) initiated the development of a regional project known as 'Western Power Corridor' (Westcor) Project to increase regional generating capacity for power generation and trading.The Westcor Project is intended to harness the hydroelectric energy of the Inga rapids site in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The planned installed capacity of the Inga 3 Power Station is 3,500 MW which will be transmitted through the countries of the participating utilities and interconnected to the rest of the SAPP transmission system.The cost of the Inga 3 Power Station and transmission liners are estimated to be 5.23 billion US dollars and five countries including South Africa, DR Congo, Botswana, Namibia and Angola are involved.

"1252","China","Possible foreign tracking space station","2003","false","Jan. 3-BEIJING-The news was presented by the government as a dazzling achievement: later this year, China plans to send men into space.Some Chinese indeed were thrilled by the declaration that China, still so backward economically in so many ways compared with the United States, will launch its first manned rocket, joining the U.S. and Russia as the world's only space-faring nations.But as the announcement filtered through the state media this week, public opinion seemed less than unanimous that China is choosing wisely to invest untold billions of dollars on a manned space program.Displaying the skepticism that China's urban population of 400 million sometimes feels toward its authoritarian government, people couldn't help wondering why a nation also overburdened by the poverty of 900 million peasants needs to explore the heavens.'I don't think it's directly related to ordinary people,' said Liu Guang Fu, 37, a copier repairman. 'It indicates China's high-tech and national defense level have improved a lot, but it must cost a lot of money, and to be honest, I would prefer the country use its resources in other ways. For example, China hasn't produced its own car.'Wei Gang Jun, 28, a sales manager, asked: 'Does this mean China is already a strong country? What benefit can ordinary people get from it? I only care about how much commission I can earn. People should be more realistic.'The government is calculating that most Chinese will be captivated by the launch of the first Chinese astronauts, sometime in the second half of the year, and it believes that going into space will give a powerful boost to national pride as well as make clear that China has ambitions to be a world power.The space program is already looking ahead to creating a space laboratory and landing on the moon by 2010, according to Ouyang Ziyuan, chief scientist of the moon program.'We will establish a base on the moon as we did in the South Pole and the North Pole,' he said in a lecture last year.China has been working to send men into space since 1992 and launched its fourth unmanned spacecraft Monday. Shenzhou IV-the name means 'divine vessel'-is fully functional to carry astronauts and has been modified from previous Shenzhou craft to make it more comfortable for living and working, officials said.A dozen former air force fighter pilots who became China's astronauts have entered the spacecraft to receive training, Su Shuangning, commander of the astronaut system, told state-run media.'With tough training in basic theories, professional skills, and flight procedures and tasks, the astronauts are absolutely capable of making their maiden voyage to outer space,' Su said.China describes its space program as 'indigenous,' but it is based on Soviet technology and has benefited from American prowess.Advances in Chinese missile technology have led to State Department civil charges against Hughes Electronics and a division of Chicago-based Boeing Co. over sharing of information with the Chinese.While the Chinese have received help from some quarters, the systems and spacecraft have been improved and re-engineered, suggesting China is capable eventually of catching up to the U.S.'They can do a very advanced spacecraft with a multiman crew and do several different missions, one of which will certainly in the future be several spacecraft [docking] together,' said Charles Vick, a space systems consultant who follows the Chinese space program.All countries that pursue space programs do so to advance basic scientific and technological research, but there can also be clear military applications, including improving rocket and missile science, advancing reconnaissance capacities, and mastering highly complex systems.'It really teaches much greater management-much better communications and overall procedures in the way you do things and not do things,' Vick said.The Chinese space system includes a launch center in the Gobi Desert, mission control near Beijing, four tracking ships anchored in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and two foreign tracking stations in Namibia and the Pacific nation of Kiribati.While China wants to avoid an arms race in space and is critical of U.S. ambitions to develop a space-based missile defense system, it is likely to gain some knowledge for space-based weapons through its program.But overall, space programs are expensive, and there is not a complete overlap between a civilian manned space program and military applications.'If you were looking at purely acquiring military capability, then a manned space program wouldn't be the most efficient way to go,' said Phillip Saunders of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif.In that way, Saunders said, China's venture into space may be mainly about prestige.'By doing a manned space program mainly on their own shows they are the technological equivalent of the superpowers,' he said.Wen Feng, 32, a hotel front desk manager, said the same.'Space will no longer only belong to those few Western countries,' Wen said. 'I'm sure those developed countries will respect China more. I'm very proud to be Chinese now.' //PAUL (Caller): Hi. Apparently, several ground-based tracking stations were used during this mission, and one is based in Namibia, I know for a fact. My question to the panel is what does this mean for the overall partnership in space between China and these countries? And also like maybe any contributions by these particular countries in some of these tracking stations and, in general, in terms of the geopolitical sort of arrangement. And I'll take my answer off the air.FLATOW: OK. Yeah, we have tracking stations around the world in different places.Mr. LOGSDON: Well, we don't too much anymore.FLATOW: Well, we had in the '60s.Mr. LOGSDON: But we had them for Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.FLATOW: Yeah.Mr. LOGSDON: This is basically no different. China has a fleet of ships that are used or deployed for tracking, and then they needed something in the African area and, apparently, just struck a deal with Namibia to locate a tracking station there. I doubt seriously that there's going to be a Namibian taikonaut anytime soon.FLATOW: Marcia Smith, do you agree?Ms. SMITH: Yes, I'e seen references in the Chinese press to the station in Namibia, but whether that is a forerunner of future cooperation, I really can't tell. But as I mentioned earlier, China does have a number of cooperative agreements in space with lots of different countries. You know, Brazil, European Space Agency and others.FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Does this signify at all--tell us anything about the next kind of satellite they may launch or, you know, learn anything about that?Ms. SMITH: The very next satellite they're going to launch?FLATOW: Yeah.Ms. SMITH: As far I know is going to be the next in this cooperative program they have with Brazil. It's called CBERS, C-B-E-R-S, China Brazil Earth Remote Sensing Satellite, which I think is supposed to go sometime this month.

The Namibian sea is highly productive,' he said.He appealed to the Chinese government to help Namibia by providing professionals to assist in the area of aquaculture.Iyambo noted that the Namibian fisheries sector is steadily growing and is well managed. About 20 per cent of Namibian fisheries contribute to world exports.He revealed that China offered N$15 million to Namibia to assist with aquaculture development.To ensure capacity training in aquaculture, 10 Namibians last year were sent to study in China.According to him, he wants at least 500 Namibians to be trained since there are few qualified experts in the field in the country at the moment.Recently, Iyambo said, they built a research institute laboratory in Kavango Region, where the Chinese assisted with equipment.At the same time, the Chinese Vice-Minister of Agriculture said Namibia and China are good friends and maintain good cooperation in many areas such as agriculture.He acknowledged the Namibian Government's empowerment of more women in the field of fisheries.Dun agreed to further cooperation in food security and help detect diseases in animals as well as protect the environment to ensure agricultural development.At the moment, China has 20 million fish farmers and is one of the biggest fishing nations in the world.'We have experience in this field and we want to share this experience with Namibia so that you develop in this field. We have experience to increase efficiency in fisheries, to increase income for fish farmers and improve life conditions. We will send technicians to work with you to push forward aquaculture,' Dun added.The Chinese delegation promised to enhance and promote student and information exchange programmes in fisheries between the two countries through diplomatic channels. He said the Chinese Government would like to support African countries to increase production through science technology.'We will dispatch more Chinese expertise. We will also provide seeds for fisheries,' said Dun.China will also provide capital, including small machinery and equipment to the fisheries ministry.'Bilateral cooperation is very good and also we can establish other new mechanisms with more technicians and equipment,' he said.It is the first time that a Chinese delegation in the fields of agriculture and fisheries visits Namibia.Members of the business community were also present in both delegations to consult on different products and markets.The delegation visited the oyster farm at Tunacor Fisheries in Walvis Bay.","Food Aid (non-disaster)","","520","Pipeline/identification","1","Grant (excluding debt forgiveness)","Unset","","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020100128e61s00336&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"1345","China","Addis-Nazareth expressway (Not a project)","2008","false","Addis Abeba, Feb 29, 2008 (The Daily Monitor/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- A Chinese company will construct the Addis-Nazareth expressway with out having to compete in a bid, Minister of Works and Urban Development Dr. Kassu Ilala, said on Thursday amid speculations over who will be awarded the contract. The minister made the remarks in a joint discussion with a high level delegation from China led by the Chinese minister of construction Wang Guangtao. Kasu said the contract for the construction of the six-lane Express Way- the first of its kind, and the first toll road to be built- would automatically be granted to China with out having to compete in competitions. 'This project is a special offer to Chinese companies of choice to come with the necessary credit facilities and get the project without any international competition,' the minister said 'I do sincerely believe that the project will be monumental to the Chinese government and people if Chinese companies participate as suggested,' minister Kassu added. Leaving the express-way project aside, Kassu invited Chinese companies to engage in the manufacturing of construction materials in order to meet the new challenges of rapid development throughout the country in the construction industry 'We feel there is a big market for all types of construction materials in the country,' Dr. Kassu observed. 'Besides, with the smooth access to the neighboring countries and beyond the chances of the market to be expanded further, as a result of the Regional Economic Cooperation Agreements, is also high,' he added. The minister further noted Chinese companies can invest in equipment leasing business with fully equipped modern workshops backed by warehouse facilities for spare parts. Dr. Kassu said Ethiopia has given infrastructure development a priority, where 70 percent of the infrastructure construction projects in Ethiopia are being carried out by the Chinese construction companies. The visiting Chinese minister Wang Guangtao on his part said of his country's strong conviction to further step up its ties with Ethiopia. He appreciated the support the Ethiopian government is providing to Chinese companies working in Ethiopia in the construction sector. Guangtao expressed his government's desire to enhance the friendly cooperation between the two sisterly countries.

All Rights Reserved. No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.China, one of the world's fastest growing economies, is increasingly looking to Africa to fulfil its monumental energy requirements in a strategic push analysts say marks sharp new competition for the continent's natural resources. China is turning to the African continent to satisfy its growing demand for energy and oil resources. As a result, some African economies are reeling under the effect of exposure to the Chinese economy.The following is the first of a series of write-ups of reports about relations between China and sub-Saharan African countries, filed by BBC Monitoring East African Unit between 8 and 24 January. This edition covers ramifications in African countries following the abolition of the WTO textile quota system, opening the world market to Chinese textile, which enjoys the lion's share of the market, as well as Chinese investments, aid to and ties with African countries.Subsequent 'China in Africa' digests will be filed weekly on Mondays at 0800 gmt; the reports, preceded by an intro, are arranged according to names of the countries in alphabetical order.African countries' concern over Chinese textile world market shareThe Chinese textile industry, which commands between 60 and 65 per cent of the world textile market, presents a threat to industries in Africa, where clothing and textile exports face decline following the 1 January 2005 expiry of the World Trade Organisation multi-fibre pact which imposed a quota system on textile exports, allowing nations like China and India to export unlimited amounts of clothing to the west. Countries like Cote d'Ioire, Lesotho, Mauritius, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe therefore have concerns about which markets will still be open to their production. (South African Press Agency web site in English, 1348 gmt on 21 January)The Lesotho development agency on Friday 21 January expressed fears that their textile industry faced decline. The Lesotho Factory Worker's Union said Wednesday 12 January said that six textile factories had closed and their foreign owners fled Lesotho, leaving some 6,650 workers. (Lesotho News Agency E-mail-Text in English, 0000 gmt on 13 Jan 2005)Officials and business leaders in Mauritius on 19 January said that less than a month after the abolition of global textile quotas, the once-booming clothing industry is already feeling the pinch. 'Against giants like China and India, there isn't a chance in 1,000 for us to compete,' said Francois Woo, director-general of the Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile, a leading manufacturer in Mauritius, which plans to open a company in China next January but has pledged not to cut back on operations in Mauritius. 'If in three years we still have a 30,000 to 40,000-strong work force, it will be exceptional,' he said. (Agence France Presse 0810 gmt on 19 January)The South African government initiated a task force to address the problem of surging imports from China, threatening to destroy the textile and clothing industries in May 2004. The team is expected to meet on 1 February after five dormant months. The South African Textile Federation has applied to the Department of Trade and Industry's International Trade Administration Commission for the invocation of the WTO China textile safeguards. The federation's president, Walter Simeoni, says the textile industry has lost 30,000 jobs in the past two years. The department's director for Asia, Willem van der Spuy, says it is 'necessary to find a lasting solution' such as solving the 'lack of competitiveness' in the industry. (South African Business Report newspaper in English, on 20 January)The government of Swaziland, the Swaziland Investment Promotion Authority, SIPA, and all other related agencies are gravely concerned at the latest developments clouding the textile and apparel industry in the country. About 70 per cent of the close to 30 textile firms, employing approximately 35,000 Swazis, already have no orders from the United States which means they might now be compelled to stop operations and wait for orders -or else close down completely.The managing director of a local textile company said 'US buyers were now preferring to buy from China where they could get as many items as possible due to its large textile production capacity.' (The Times of Swaziland in English, on 21 January, and The Swazi Observer in English, on 18 January)Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions says the Zimbabwean textile sector has been adversely affected by to massive imports of Chinese-made clothing. A Chinese-made bush shirt sells for between 20,000 Zimbabwean (three US dollars or 2.30 euros) and 50,000 dollars against 80,000 to about 200,000 for one made locally.Lovemore Matombo, the trade union president told AFP: 'It is actually destroying the local textile and clothing industry. We have got well over 75,000 people in the sector and many have closed shop and several people have been laid off. Last year alone, about 30 textile factories and shops downed their shutters.' (Agence France Presse 0546 gmt on 25 January)Chinese line of credit to AngolaThe Eximbank of China turned out to be the most valuable of all to Angola in 2004. The Angolan government obtained from it one of its most important credit lines using oil as collateral, valued at 2bn dollars, to finance, among other projects, the rebuilding and recovery of infrastructure destroyed during the war, notably the national railroads network, road repairs, bridges.The agreement, signed in March 2004 between Eximbank of China and the Angolan Government, provides for the funds to be applied towards projects to be presented by Chinese companies. 'Angola, with its 12 million people, expects an influx of about four million Chinese citizens during the period of application of the line of credit. 'Many Chinese companies have already been set up here but we are going to see many more arrive in the next 12 months,' said Bastos de Almeida, finance ministry spokesman. 'Several Chinese companies have already been awarded contracts and are operating in Angola's public works sector and many more are expected in 2005. Many countries are not happy because we are doing so much business with China. But Chinese companies are quick and efficient and much cheaper than many others. The Chinese credit line will be absolutely key to our economic activity this year,' he added.Negotiations are under way between both national airlines - Angolan Airlines, TAAG, and China Airlines - to invest in more frequent flights between Luanda and Beijing, via London, to respond to the growing traffic between the two countries.Many Chinese companies are already operating in the building sector in Angola, after having been given important contracts, funded by the credit line, to rebuild railway lines between the various Angolan Luanda, Benguela and Namibe provinces. In an effort to boost local businesses, each contract awarded to a Chinese firm would have to include at least 30 per cent involvement of Angolan companies and workers, he added.

The first sign of change of an era is that it is China that is reported to be assisting President Laurent Gbagbo's regime, which is finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet at the end of every month... just after the 6 November 2004 French bombings and the ensuing anti-French demonstrations that shook Cote d'Ioire, China made a gesture of solidarity towards that country to the tune of 1.5bn CFA francs.'The commentary then says: 'Although, the political aspect of this open commitment on the part of China has not as yet been officially mentioned, one can only note that the Chinese have come 'to compete' with the French in the economic field, where the French have invested more than '1.5bn CFA francs with more than 600 small and medium-sized enterprises, most of which have been hit by the November 2004 crisis.'The Chinese have invested in the mining and energy sectors, the latest case in point being the entry of the Chinese company, 'Sinopec Oerseas Oil   Gas Ltd' on the lucrative oil field CI-112, off the coast of San Pedro, where that company has taken 27 per cent of the block as compared with 27 per cent also of the US oil company, Vanco. A first well of this oil field will be drilled in February this year.China's interest in Cote d'Ioire has been attributed to Taiwanese influence in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Senegal.

He said the vehicles would go a long way in alleviating transport problems that the army has experienced of late.The Chinese embassy's charge d'affaires, Mrs Ma Deyun, said the vehicles were procured after the two countries signed an agreement for cooperation in different areas of interest. She said China and Zimbabwe have enjoyed good relations since the days of the liberation struggle and they have always supported each other in times of need. 'We are proud of the achievements we have made in various areas of cooperation,' said Mrs Deyun.Trade and economic cooperation between Zimbabwe and China has grown tremendously. Under the partnership with China, several joint venture companies have been established in the country. China also remains the biggest buyer of Zimbabwe's tobacco. Under the Zimbabwe-China Joint Commission, Zimbabwe has benefited through the Chinese government's concessionary and interest free loans and grants.(The Herald newspaper in English 13 January, Government-owned and controlled national television ZTV in Shona, 1530 gmt on 12 January)Zimbabwe is fighting an invasion of Chinese goods, locally known as 'zhing-zhongs', which trade unions and businesses say are undercutting local industry already struggling for survial in a bruised economy. Zimbabweans call Chinese products 'zhing-zhongs' a term which has taken on a derisive connotation to describe anything that is substandard, irrespective of the country of origin.Economists say the proliferation of inexpensive Chinese goods, although a worldwide phenomenon and especially acute in Africa, is partly fuelled by President Robert Mugabe's policy of looking to Asia after being shunned by the West. 'While China makes some very good products, there was quite an element of dumping here with factory seconds and rejects coming in, and this was true especially of footwear and clothes,' says leading economist Eric Bloch.Last year saw a major influx of goods from China, prompting the government to drastically increase the import duties on the merchandise that includes everything from toothpaste to clothes to electronic equipment and solar panels. 'It was a very serious threat and then the finance ministry on 25 November 2004 substantially increased duties to level the playing field,' Bloch told AFP.'Previously, the import duty was 10 per cent of value plus 60 Zimbabwean dollars (one US cent) for every kilogram in weight, now it is 100,000 dollars across-the-board for all items.'Footwear giant Bata, which has a factory in Zimbabwe, said sales had dropped 26 per cent in 2004, owing to the influx of cheap Asian, and especially Chinese goods. 'These imports continue unabated, with requests by the footwear industry to look at the situation falling on deaf ears,' said managing director Edwin Duthie. 'Unless some control is implemented, I can see 2005 showing a further decline,' said Duthie.Several shops in Harare have closed and have been taken over by people selling Chinese goods. (Agence France Presse 0546 gmt on 25 January)Interest in Southern SudanUnder the peace agreement, oil leases signed by the government during the war will be respected. The largest lease holders include the China National Petroleum Company.Experts predict that oil and gas companies will rush in to expand Sudan's oil production from the 345,000 barrels a day recorded in June 2004. The country has proven reserves of 635 million barrels, much of which could not be accessed during the war because of fighting. (Associated Press on 11 January)Sudan People's Liberation Movement, SPLM, leader John Garang on 23 January said on his return to Rumbek, southern Sudan, that his movement wants a balance of nations in the UN peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern Sudan.Despite China being among a handful of the countries that responded to the UN appeal to contribute personnel for a peacekeeping mission, the SPLM has reservations about it. SPLM/A officials say they would have reservations about any participation by Malaysia or China, because of their oil production joint ventures with the Islamist government in Khartoum, or by Pakistan due to its Islamic identity.

Doe (SKD) sports complex in Paynesville by the Government of the People's Republic of China have finally been completed and the keys to the facility given to the Government of Liberia. >>The official turnover ceremony took place on Saturday, July 21, 2007 at the SKD with a host of government officials led by the nation's chief patron of sports, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a number of sports authorities and other dignitaries in attendance. >>The turnover program during which the public was initially prevented from attending was later given zeal and momentum when President Sirleaf ordered that the gates be opened to allow in hundreds of eager Liberians, who had gone to get a glimpse of the newly renovated stadium. >>Although no sporting activities were held at the stadium during the turnover ceremony, the public trooped in the stadium to entertain themselves with cultural performances in the glittering stadium which had been in ruins for months. >>The brief late-evening turnover program witnessed the project manager of the stadium turn over the keys of the stadium to the Chinese Ambassador, Lin Songtin who subsequently handed it over to the government of Liberia through the Foreign Minister, George Wallace. Minister Wallace then gave the keys to President Sirleaf, who officially and formally presented it to the Deputy Minister for Youth and Sports, now Acting Minister, Mr. Jeremiah P. Witherspoon. Minister Wallace and Ambassador Songtian also signed the handover certificate of the SKD stadium renovation project. >>Speaking during the program, Minister Witherspoon expressed gratitude to the government and the people of the People's Republic of China for responding to the call of the Ministry by renovating the stadium and transforming it into a modern sports facility. He said by undertaking this task for the young people of Liberia was an indication that China is indeed a true friend of the Liberians. >>Minster Witherspoon explained that the stadium contains accommodation for many sporting disciplines to have equal access to the usage of the newly renovated multi-faceted stadium. He also lauded the President for her support and keen interest exhibited for the renovation project. He assured her that the facilities would not be misused. >>Making remarks prior to the turnover of the keys of the stadium, Chinese Ambassador Lin Songtian stated that the renovated stadium was a special gift from the People's Republic of China to the Liberian people for its 160th Independence anniversary celebration. He said the Chinese government hails the renovation as a symbol of its goodwill and friendship to the Liberian government and people. >>He disclosed that the renovation project covered the scope of repairing, reprising, upgrading and the additional building of the facilities ranging from studio contraction to digital scoreboard; public address system; core and track; lighting system; fire fighting system; monitoring system and telephone system. He put the total implementation cost to over 9 million United States dollars. He noted that the stadium has now been renovated and upgraded to modern international standard. >>Amb. Songtin further said the stadium had served as a symbol of friendship between Liberia and China as it had witnessed the ups and downs of the bilateral relationship between the two countries. He said football is important in Liberia for the national reconciliation, especially in this post war era. He said this is why the Chinese government has decided to renovate the SKD as one of the first major project after the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two nations in October of 2003. He said it is hoped that the renovated stadium would play its role in promoting national reconciliation, solidarity and unity of the Liberian people and further strengthen and consolidate the existing cordial relationship, friendship and partnership between the two countries and peoples. >>Receiving the keys, President Sirleaf expressed appreciation to the government of the People's Republic of China for the undertaking, which she said further hails the cordial and friendly relationship that exists between the two nations and peoples. The President then briefly recounted the history of the stadium, which she said represents the vision of the late President William R. Tolbert Jr., under whose administration the stadium was incepted and completed under the regime of the late President, Samuel K. Doe after whom the stadium was named. >>She remarked, 'We therefore reaffirm that this sports complex is the Samuel Kanyon Doe complex and will remain as such.' Amidst applause, President Sirleaf continued, 'anyone, who suggests it otherwise, is simply engaging in baseless rumor mongering.' >>The President said as the country approaches its 160th Independence anniversary, the sports complex renovated by the Chinese people represents not only the spirit of international cooperation but also a symbol that would be used to promote national reconciliation and unity and bring together sports as a unifying factor. >>The President finally called on Liberians to maintain the stadium as she has already begun receiving information that people have begun stealing materials from the stadium. >>Document AFNWS00020070724e37o0013g>","Government and Social Services","","","Completion","3","Unset","Unset","","Liberia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020070724e37o0013g&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"1543","China","Construction of airport (MCC Money going to Chinese company)","2010","false","BAMAKO, June 30 (Reuters) - China's Sinohydro Corporation has signed a contract with Mali to build a new airport for the capital, Bamako, a $71.6 million project that will be financed by the U.S. Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC).The new airport will take 23 months to build and will have a capacity to handle 1.5 million passengers a year, seeking to boost infrastructure in West Africa, a region that suffers from chronic transport problems.The new airport would 'open up the country and ease air links between Mali and other countries, improving commercial connections and reducing costs', U.S. envoy to Mali Gillian Milovanovic said at the signing ceremony late on Tuesday.'For example, fruit and vegetable producers will be able to access regional markets more easily (and) new markets and destinations will come within reach,' she added.Bamako's runway will be lengthened by 500 metres and a new cargo hangar will be built as part of the project.Aside from poor infrastructure, a lack of reliable airlines further complicates travel and transport in West Africa.The accord follows an agreement signed in 2006 by the MCC, which provides grants to poor countries that meet criteria on good governance and economic freedoms, and which is worth $461 million to Mali over five years.The project is aimed at increasing agricultural production and productivity, and expanding the land-locked West African nation's access to markets and trade.Mali is also a key U.S. ally in the war on terrorism in the region, where al Qaeda's local wing has stepped up attacks on national armies, kidnappings of foreigners and is profiting from the drugs trade.

'I am happy that the first shipment of six containers of farming tools is already here, and the second shipment of 18 containers will call the port of within one week,' Lin said. 'Now it is time for the dear farmers of Liberia to be armed with farming tools, and work hard in your rich soil for your food sufficiency and better life,' Lin added. According to the Chinese ambassador, the tools are under a 'gratuitous assistance and is being implemented as a top priority'. Some of the tools include 630,000 pieces of cutlass, hoe, axe, file, digger shovel, rake, among others. The farming tools bring to three the number of significant bilateral assistance to Liberia from the Chinese government since the inauguration of the Johnson-Sirleaf's administration last 16 January. Following the visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing to Liberia in January and a high-level Chinese military delegation in March, the Chinese government announced a 5m dollars interest-free new loan to the country and a 600,000 dollars assistance to build the capacity of the Liberian army. In addition to these, Lin said his government would 'help the Liberian government push forward the process of national reconstruction', adding that 'China is ready to write off all the overdue debts Liberia owes China as of the end of 2004.' Lin also said China has offered duty-free special arrangement to open the last Chinese markets to Liberian products. Responding to these gestures, president Johnson-Sirleaf said 'This is another manifestation in a very concrete way of support in the partnership between Liberia and China that Liberians can enjoy.' Tens of thousands of Liberians are expected to return to subsistence farming activities following 14 years of civil war which had displaced them from their localities. Regarding the debt waiver, she said it was a surprise, but she assured that her government would work with the Chinese government on the gesture, reaffirming her government's support for the 'one China' policy.

"1624","China","Matured-Debt Cancellation (duplicate with ID: 1607)","2006","false","The many years of bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and Liberia, no matter the few strains experienced out of resumption of ties with Taiwan by previous governments, have been quite rewarding especially with the former providing needed economic and technical assistance to the latter either through grants or debt arrangements. Given Liberia's disposition in recent decades, however, especially with gradual recession witnessed in its economic outlook that has made it quite difficult in meeting some of its commitments to friendly nations and institutions. The nearly 15 years of civil crisis destroyed all amost all of its infrastructure, as well as institutionalized structures exacerbating the issue thus requiring the need to make adjustments suiting its abilities to make good on all previous national and international obligations. With the visit to the PRC by the democratically-elected leader of Liberia, Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in recent weeks, tremendous achievements have been made with that great country promising number of assistance including removing the heavy burden on the post-crisis government. Specifically, assurances given in various fields, as well as promise to relief the Liberian nation from matured debts by the PRC has indeed invigorated the spirit of planners and financial executives in charting courses that will once more see the Nation as being credit-worthy and an adherent to instruments legally-binding. From Beijing, The Analyst brings to you the unfolding developments on progress being made as a result of the Liberian leader's ongoing visit. Liberia stands to benefit from matured-debt cancellation by the People's Republic of China, President Hu Jintao has assured President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf who is currently on a visit to that great republic. The PRC has promised to assist Liberia with its capacity-building programs through training, build two village elementary schools, avail 13 scholarships for students in 2006/2007, as well as provide anti-malaria drugs worth RMB$1 million, reported to be on its way to the country. According to the latest dispatch from Beijing, an agreement on economic and technical cooperation already signed between the two governments will also result to a grant of RMB$40,000,000 grant, for the completion of various projects including the renovation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex in Monrovia. A memorandum of understanding also reached provides for general cooperation on the development of one of Liberia's seaports, as well as the exploration of mineral resources. According to the dispatch, the assurances were given on Wednesday when President Sirleaf met with the PRC leader, Hu Jintao, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, where she was formally received. During official talks, both leaders reportedly expressed happiness over the growing cordial relationship between the two countries and the mutual desire to increase cooperation in the economic and trade sectors. In a related development, Chairman Wu Bangguo of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) yesterday met with the Liberian leader in Beijing, at which the parliamentarian underscored the need to strengthen exchanges in the future between the NPC and the Liberian National Legislature. According to the Xinhua News Agency, during the meeting, Wu lauded Sino-Liberian relations since the resumption of ties, following a break in diplomatic ties with Taiwan in October 2003. 'China appreciates the Liberian government and its Parliament, for its adherence to the one-China Policy as well as its support to China's reunification cause,' Wu is quoted to have said. Wu further lauded the cooperation between China and Liberia, describing it as potentially huge, proposing further that his government would like to work with Liberia in exploring new ways and methods in materializing a consensus reached by both leaders that would benefit the two countries. Responding, President Sirleaf reiterated Liberia's unwavering stance in advancing diplomatic ties with China, terming it as an 'unswerving policy.' The Liberian leader observed that the achievements of China's economic reform are very impressive, adding that Liberia hopes to borrow from its experience, with the strengthening of cooperation in the fields of agriculture, fishery, infrastructure development and mineral exploration. President Johnson-Sirleaf is also due to attend the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation slated for November 4-5. Upon the first visit by the Liberian leader to the PRC, she was taken to the Shenzhen Province in Southern China, near the Hong Kong border, where she and the Mayor of the City, Xu Zongheng, expressed strong desires to promote cooperation between the two countries, particularly the Shenzhen State and the port-City of Buchanan in Grand Bassa County. President Johnson-Sirleaf is quoted as having assured Mayor Zongheng of her country's post-war reconstruction drive for renewal, noting that her visit to Shenzhen was to attract private sector partnership. Relations between the PRC and Liberia dates back to 1971 when the latter supported China's admittance into the United Nations. Although diplomatic ties have broken twice on premises of Liberia resuming ties with Taiwan in 1988 and 1997, which the Liberian leader attributed to 'narrow and short-term considerations by previous Liberian governments,' ties between both countries resumed in 2003. Meanwhile, latest reports speak about the presence of 48 African heads of state in Beijing to attend the China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit. The forum will highlight roundtable discussions between and amongst leaders, as well as business communities, aimed at establishing mutual cooperation. It is expected to be headed by Chinese President Jintao and Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi.

"1721","China","Construction of hospital Inactive","2010","false","Mar 19, 2010 (The Informer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has described as 'a promise fulfilled' the construction of the US$10M-100-bedroom hospital in Tapita, Nimba County, after she toured the facilities Friday, March 5, 2010.The colossal structure, which is expected to be one of the best modern hospitals in the West African region, is being constructed by the Chinese Government as part of that country's bilateral assistance to the rebuilding of post war Liberia.Chinese Ambassador to Liberia Zhou Yuxiao, who led the tour of the facilities, said construction work would be completed by July for the hospital to officially be dedicated before July 26 as part of programs marking Liberia's 163rd Independence anniversary.Making a brief statement after the tour, Ambassador Zhou, who later formed part of the President's weeklong tour of southeastern Liberia, told gathered Nimba citizens that the Chinese Government had wanted to build the Hospital in Monrovia and not Tapita.He related that 'But, the Mandan [President Sirleaf] said no, no we need it in Tapita more than in Monrovia. That's why the hospital is here.''Our plan is to turn it over to you before or on your independence day, July 26,' he said.Ambassador Zhou disclosed that the Chinese Government will fully equip the hospital and it will be the highest technologically advanced modern hospital in Liberia with sophisticated equipment.Though the Chinese envoy expressed elation that the project was near completion, he feared that such a gigantic building without doctors and qualified medical practitioners would not be a hospital.'So we need the doctors, we need the nurses, we need the technicians,' the Ambassador noted and disclosed that discussions were underway with the Liberian Foreign Minister to address the problem.Discussions, he said, are focusing on whether doctors and other professional medical practitioners will be imported from China to run the hospital while locals are being trained, or otherwise.He then commended the people of Taipta for their total cooperation and support to the work. He said unlike other areas where locals stole materials, the people of Tapita have never stolen any of the materials being used to construct the hospital.'In Nimba [there's] no stealing. I love Liberia and I love the citizens of Nimba even more,' the Chinese diplomat stated.For her part, President Sirleaf historicized that when she visited Tapita in 2006, she promised that her government would restore the damaged hospital there, after the people took her on the site.'I promised them that I will go and look into it and talk to some of our friends and we will put priority on this hospital,' President Sirleaf recalled telling elder of Tapita.President Sirleaf said her administration prioritized two major projects: the construction of the new university building at Fendall and the Tapita hospital, rather than rebuilding the Executive Mansion, where she should be residing and working.'This was done so that we can be able to keep our promises to the people; it is a promise fulfilled,' she stated amidst thundering applauses and battle cries.The President said when the Chinese Envoy inspected the area he told her that they would prefer building a new modern hospital instead of renovating the damaged one the initially stood there.'I'm happy that it has come this far,' the Liberian leader asserted, lauding the citizens for their good record with the constructors.

In Chambishi, 60,000 jobs will be created while less than a thousand jobs will be created in the high-tech economic zone. Many more jobs will be created in southern province,' said Mutati.In Chambishi, the Chinese planned to construct a copper smelter and other projects in mining and agriculture.Authorities had agreed to orient the Chinese on Zambian labour laws and culture to avoid tensions similar to those which forced Chinese President Hu Jintao to cancel a trip to Chambishi during a visit to Zambia in 2006.Zambia's opposition and labour unions accuse the Chinese of failing to observe safety standards and of paying workers salaries below the government minimum wage threshold of about 70 Zambian kwacha.'There are some things they need to learn and they have told us they are willing to do so,' Mutati said, adding that Zambia had opened its doors to Chinese investors because 'they are different from the West and tend to be quicker in transactions which make sense.'ZAMBIA-CHINA/ (INTERVIEW)|LANGEN|AFA|CSA|LBY|RWSA|RWS|REULB|GNS|BNX|SXNADocument LBA0000020070626e36q0018f","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070626e36q0018f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"2351","China","Kinkon dam renovation","2006","false","InCONAKRY, July 19 (Reuters) - China has upgraded one hydropower dam in blackout-prone Guinea, the world's top exporter of the aluminium ore bauxite, and plans to modernise another, state radio and diplomatic sources said on Wednesday.China has ramped up investment and diplomatic activity in Africa as it seeks new supplies of energy and raw materials to fuel its fast-growing economy.State radio said the Guinean government took possession of the Kinkon dam at Pita, some 400 km (250 miles) north of the capital Conakry, on Wednesday after a $2.5 million overhaul and upgrade which increased its capacity to 3.4 megawatts from 3.0.Diplomatic sources in Conakry said China was planning to renovate another hydropower dam at Tinkisso in the east of the country.In December a Greek company, 3PL, which has a joint bauxite exploration venture with Aluminium Corp. of China Ltd (Chalco) in Guinea said it had signed a deal to build a 1.2 million tonne alumina refinery in the northeast of the country.An alumina plant would require significant energy resources but it was not immediately clear whether the dam overhauls were linked to this development. Alumina is extracted from bauxite and then smelted into aluminium.Despite living on top of one third of the world's bauxite reserves, most of Guinea's 9 million people survie on less than a dollar per day. A general strike last month over rising living costs triggered rioting in which at least 11 people died.The government says it has spent around $500 million on its power grid and new diesel generators in recent years, but Conakry and other towns still face frequent power blackouts, which have been exacerbated by high fuel prices.'Each one of these generators costs us the equivalent of 350 litres of diesel per hour -- that's nearly $9,000 a day at the current exchange rate,' said Sidy Diallo, spokesman for state power utility Electricite de Guinee (EDG).In May, China offered to build a 50,000-seat soccer stadium free of charge to help Guinea's bid to host the 2012 African Nations Cup tournament.ENERGY-GUINEA-CHINA|LANGEN|GNN|AFN|Z|ABN|O|OIL|C|MTL|E|RBN|RNP|DNP|PCO|PENDocument LBA0000020060719e27j001fw中几合作第四次会议成功落下帷幕 中几两国政府第四次合作会议成功落下帷幕。会上两国就双方在“友好关系”各方面进行了回顾。      中几之间合作在中断了六年之后，今次取得了重大的进展。这是中国商务部副部长魏建国访问团访问科纳科里的重要成果。几内亚外交、合作、非洲一体化和海外几内亚侨民部部长阿卜杜-卡贝雷-卡马拉接待了魏部长访问团。      此次会面主要就医药卫生、矿业能源、教育、农业、商贸、交通运输等方面进行了探讨。      中几合作已经有50年的历史了，双方友好关系顺利发展。此次代表团的访问进一步加深了两国的关系。魏部长宣布向几内亚捐赠4千万元人民币（相当于6百万美金）用于实现建造乡村学校和医院；为几内亚独立50周年送上50辆“红旗”牌轿车；带来大量的食物和化学肥料等物资并将在几内亚建设一家现代医院用于疟疾防治和预防。      魏副部长也强调了中几两国的经贸合作关系。2007年，双方进出口额达到了367.000.000美金，是2002年的7倍。魏部长还表示希望两国年进出口额能达到10亿美金。      双方就此次访问表示满意并强调了增进双方互访的必要性。计划将于两年后在北京召开第五次中几合作会议。      Coba的蔗糖工厂，Mamou的农具工厂，Kinkon和Tinkisso的水电站，Sèkhoutoureya的人民大会堂，Sonfonia的发射中心，Koloma的电台新建筑，Nongo的5万座体育场……这些都是中国援建几内亚的项目，为几内亚提供了重要的支持也是中几友好关系顺利平稳发展的坚实基础。因此阿卜杜-卡贝雷-卡马拉也表示几内亚将制定矿业资源一揽子发展计划以支持和保证几内亚的交通、水电、农业等方面的基础设施建设总体规划。","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Hydropower","","Completion","3","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Guinea","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060719e27j001fw&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The following is the text of report by Liu Dongkai, entitled: 'Jiang Zemin meets with Morocco's King Mohammed VI' by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)Beijing, 5 February: Chairman Jiang Zemin met with Moroccan King Mohammed VI in the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. The leaders exchanged sincere opinions on bilateral relations and major international and regional topics of interest, and reached a broad consensus in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.Jiang Zemin warmly welcomed King Mohammed to China, and expressed his pleasure at once again seeing the King in Beijing.

He said: The friendship between China and Morocco is deep and long. In their long-term struggle to obtain their independence and be liberated, to protect their national sovereignty and dignity, and to promote world peace and development, the people of both nations have always shown each other sympathy and support. There has been sincere, friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation based on equality on matters involving economic development and construction of the nation. Today, we once more take a look backwards at history, standing here at a strategic height, and take long-term interests as our point of departure. We set the direction for the relations between our two nations in the new century. Jiang Zemin suggested that China and Morocco should continue their joint efforts on the following points:1. Establishing a long-term, stable friendly relationship of cooperation between the two nations for the future.2. Promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.3. Enhancing coordination and discussion to jointly protect the rights and interests of developing nations and protect world peace.Jiang Zemin praised Morocco's long-standing adherence to the viewpoint that there is but one China, and thanked Morocco for its support of China in the area of human rights.

This has been done to bring about positive social and economic benefits to both sides. China will work hard with Morocco on the basis of equality and mutual benefit to strongly enhance trade cooperation between the two nations, and to bring about common development.King Mohammed expressed his thanks to Jiang Zemin for the invitation to visit China and for the warm welcome he had received after arriving in Beijing.

I hope that China will play an active role in stimulating all the parties involved to quickly find a resolution, and to break through the deadlock and resume the process of negotiation.Jiang Zemin thanked the king for his summary. He emphasized that the key to the Middle East problem is a reasonable resolution of the Palestinian problem, and re-establishment of the legal rights of the Palestinian nation. Israel must return the occupied Arab territory. The principle of 'land for peace' cannot be dropped. He said that China has always firmly supported and has worked hard for the Arab nations in recovering their lost lands, and has supported the Palestinian people in recovering their legal rights as a nation, and is willing to work with the Arab nations, including Morocco, to maintain normal communications and discussions to continue to play a positive role in promoting an early resolution to the Middle East problem.Jiang Zemin expressed his approval of Morocco's constructive role and unique function as chair of the Jerusalem committee in maintaining the stability of the Middle East for the long term, and promoting the peace process.The two leaders also exchanged opinions on the fight against terrorism, Sino-African relations, the Chinese-African Cooperation Forum, and other international and regional issues.After the talks concluded, Jiang Zemin and King Mohammed VI appeared together at the signing ceremony for the 'Economic and technical cooperation agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Morocco,' and four other agreements and documents.Before the talks, Jiang Zemin formally welcomed King Mohammed VI to China.

'This support will be utilized to fulfil the fund gap of the project that will be agreed and approved by our two governments,' Mkulo said. He further said that about 2.9m dollars (3.8bn shillings) would be for Zanzibar and would be used for the same purpose.According to the joint statement, about 100m dollars (132.9bn shillings) will be for the concessional loan framework agreement for Information Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure network project.The minister further noted that in 2008, China provided about 70m dollars (93bn shillings) for the implementation of the first phase of the project. 'Upon completion of this project, we expect to have improved information transmission within the country,' he said.According to the agreement, about 70.4m dollars (93.5bn shillings) will be utilized to implement Zanzibar International Airport Terminal II project.Mkulo said that the funds will be used for the construction of Zanzibar international airport terminal two, a project which is very important for promoting tourism and general development of Zanzibar, Tanzania and east Africa. 'When completed the airport project will also stimulate other economic activities across the country,' said MkuloThe minister also asked the government of China to assist the historical Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (Tazara), since that corridor offers the shortest link between the port of Dar es Salaam and southern African countries.For his part, the Chinese minister said his government would continue supporting Tanzania in different socio-economic sectors.Meanwhile, the Chinese minister yesterday proposed measures to further develop Sino-Tanzanian economic and trade cooperation. Chen made the proposal during his meeting with Industry Trade and Marketing Minister Dr Mary Nagu noting that the bilateral economic and trade cooperation was currently developing rapidly with China's imports to Tanzania up 46.7 per cent in the first 11 months of last year and total Chinese direct investments in the east African country exceeding 200m dollars.The investment sectors have expanded into agriculture, pharmacy, mining and commodity production from construction, textile and transportation. A number of infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, power projects as well as water supply projects have been constructed through bilateral cooperation, the Chinese commerce minister said.He added that the development of Sino-Tanzanian development aid was going smoothly, and the eight measures announced at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Summit to promote the bilateral cooperation had been comprehensively implemented.In order to further develop the Sino-Tanzanian economic and trade cooperation, Chen proposed measures to continue expanding bilateral trade as the two sides had already exchanged documents on tax exemption to some export products to China under the new measures announced at the fourth ministerial meeting of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on 8 to 9 November, last year, a move that would lead to expansion of Tanzania's exports to China.The Chinese minister also stressed the strengthening of investment cooperation, initiating the negotiation and signing agreements on investment protection and exemption of dual taxation, which would create an advantage to expand China's investment in Tanzania as well as local job opportunities.Source: The Guardian website, Dar es Salaam, in English 16 Jan 10ab564b91","Multisector","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Grant (excluding debt forgiveness)","Unset","","Tanzania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020100116e61g000ul&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"2430","China","Pipelines (Duplicate of 1649)","2011","true","563 words23 August 201106:56 AMReuters NewsLBAEnglish(c) 2011 Reuters LimitedBEIJING, Aug 23 (Reuters) - China's state energy giants are cautious about oil and gas investment under the rebel-ruled government in Libya, concerned about the uncertainty of a new regime and believing European firms will be politically favoured.(For a related story on China urges Libya to protect investments: )Instead companies like CNPC, CNOOC and Sinopec would be more comfortable providing services in oil prospecting, oilfield engineering and drilling, areas they focused on in the era of Muammar Gaddafi.The following gives a snapshot of Chinese firms' main oil-related activities in the north African nation.CRUDE SUPPLY PACTUnipec, the trading arm of state oil firm Sinopec, has a yearly crude supply pact under which China shipped in about 150,000 barrels a day last year, roughly 3 percent of the country's total imports.China started to raise sharply imports of Libyan crude oil since 2009 as a domestic refining boom prompted firms to scout for new supplies.Imports in the first four months of this year averaged 131,000 bpd, customs data show, before being cut off from May.Traders said the lost supply has been covered by oil from the Middle East.OIL SERVICESChina's oil firms have barely any equity oil production in Libya. Instead, they have focused on services, with two CNPC units -- Great Wall Drilling Co and BGP Inc -- among the most active in Libya. CNPC had about 400 staff there, CNOOC 77 and Sinopec less than 10.A Beijing-based oil service executive told Reuters on Tuesday that he expected engineering and service companies to return to Libya soon.'Post-war reconstruction needs more petroleum engineering services and these services are politically less sensitive and normally are done through international tenders,' he said.CNOOC's oilfield service company had four drilling rigs operating onshore.PetroChina , CNPC's listed arm, has no investment there. Sinopec's spokesperson Huang Wensheng said the firm would look out for new opportunities in Libya.'But the key is whether there will be good ones. The political situation is just too unclear. We have yet to conduct risk assessment on Libya, which is a necessary step in our overseas investment,' Huang said.PIPELINES, FAILED ACQUISITIONCNPC won a $230 million contract in 2002 to build twin 520 kilometre oil and gas pipelines for Italian firm Eni that link the Wafa field in south Libya with Melitah, about 50 km away from Tripoli.CNPC was forced to end a $417 million bid to acquire Canadian oil producer Verenex Energy Inc in 2009, after the Libyan government refused to approve the deal.CNPC was among the 47 qualified foreign firms to compete for acreage in an oil and gas licensing round in 2006.OTHER CONSTRUCTIONApart from oil services, Chinese state firms were building railways, houses and water supply projects in Libya.One such company, China Metallurgy Group Corp, was building a 5,000-apartment residential project and also infrastructure for a cement factory. The firm said in March that some 5 billion yuan ($780 million) of the contract was unfulfilled.China Railway Construction said early this year that about $3.55 billion worth of contracts in Libya were suspended due to the war.(Reporting by Chen Aizhu, Su Dan and Xu Wan; Editing by Michael Urquhart)CHINA-LIBYA/OILReuters LimitedDocument LBA0000020110823e78n000iz","Unset","","","Unset","","Unset","Unset","","Libya","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020110823e78n000iz&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

LOME, Togo (AP) - As followers drummed and danced, Togo President Gnassingbe Eyadema laid the corner stone for a new multimillion-dollar presidential palace being built by the Chinese for the poor west African nation. Telecommunications Minister Faure Gnassingbe -- the president's son -- called the project 'a priority for Togo,' saying it would give the nation a palace 'befitting the dignity and status of a modern presidency.' Chinese diplomats and Togo leaders at Thursday's ceremony declined to give an exact price. The palace is the latest high-profile gift from the Chinese as they vie across Africa and much of the developing world for diplomatic recognition, in competition with Taiwan. Chinese also are competing with the West for oil, minerals and other resources in many West African nations. Other Chinese-built landmarks for Togo include a recently constructed US$36 million sports stadium, a hospital, and the Palace of Congress. Laying the cornerstone, Eyadema declared, 'The people of Togo are happy to celebrate with you the glory of Sino-Togolese friendship.' Eyadema took power in 1967 after Africa's first post-colonial coup, and stands today as Africa's longest-ruling leader. International rights organizations accuse his regime of suppressing the opposition and charge him with widespread rights abuses, and most aid to the tiny country remains frozen. A nation dependent mostly on commercial and subsistence agriculture, Togo has more than one-third of its 5.4 million people living in poverty. With development and economic reform stalled, roads and other infrastructure are crumbling. Opposition leaders condemned the mansion project. 'What Togo needs is a solid foundation for the country's move toward multiparty democracy,' said Cornelius Aidam, vice president of the Convergence Pan African Patriotic Party. 'Not a new presidential palace.' eg-ek  ''Five years ago, the Chinese constructed a modern football stadium complex in Kege, on the outskirts of Lome believed to have cost over 25 billion CFA Francs.'","Other (see notes)","Sports, culture","","Completion","3","In-kind contribution","Unset","","Togo","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=APRS000020031107dzb7001fs&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The plant would be in Kabwe at the former Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines lead and zinc mine which was closed in 1984.Company deputy general manager, Lee Ke Kun, told Platts Thursday that the company would obtain its raw manganese from its high grade manganese operation in Mkushi, a district in Central Zambia, known for its abundance of manganese deposits. He said the company would have no market problems for its product as the plant would be the first of its kind in Zambia. Lee Ke Kun did not say how much manganese the company would process.Zambia's most notable manganese operation was in Mansa, northern Zambia, which once hosted the country's only dry cell battery manufacturing plant. The manganese mines at Mansa, however, have been unproductive since economic liberalization policies led to the collapse of the battery factory in the late 1990s. Also, data released by alternative investment market and Franfurt listed Red Rock Resources plc in April 2006 indicated that manganese samples from the Mkushi prospect returned analytical results of up to 52% manganese. Red Rock Chairman, Andrew Bell whose company holds a license covering 400 hectars at Chifwefwe, said the results were encouraging. --James Mwambazi, newsdesk@platts.com ","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PLATT00020070405e3450015r&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved. No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.Text of report by Guineenews website on 30 OctoberLast weekend China donated 3.127 metric tonnes of rice, 667 tonnes of chemical fertilizers, and 16 tonnes of seedlings to the Republic of Guinea, a country blessed with vast agricultural plains.This donation by the People's Republic of China brings the total amount to approximately over 11bn Guinea francs (1.1bn Cfa francs).The charge d'affaires of the Chinese embassy made the following observation during the presentation of the donation: 'This donation of rice, fertilizer and seedlings is a way for my country to assist Guinea in ensuring its food supply while significantly reducing the country's dependency on rice exports.'In the presence of Cooperation Minister Mrs Sidibe Fatoumata Kaba, the Chinese diplomat added that this token was an expression of the will of his government to maintain and strengthen the 40-year-old relations between both nations.According to some sources, Guinea's imports of white rice are primarily from Asian countries and are estimated to be over 300,000 metric tonnes per year because the Guinean farming sector lacks public and private investment.Recently China has made no mystery of its plans to invest in Guinea.Through the medium of Eximbank and Syno-Hydro (a company specializing in international large-scale projects) the Chinese government funded the construction of a dam in the town of Souapiti, with a ceiling of about 1bn dollars.Last September China also cancelled Guinea's debt in the amount of 45m dollars.Source: Guineenews website in French 30 Oct 06a54d8b4fDocument BBCAP00020061101e2b1001xh","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Hydropower","","Completion","3","Unset","Unset","","Guinea","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020061101e2b1001xh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

We are almost at the point of closing the deal,' Chitundu told Reuters.Chitundu said Zesco, which engaged China's Sinohydro last year to start the Kariba North bank expansion project had already spent $18 million on the project, where a fire damaged the plant and killed two workers a fortnight ago.Chitundu said Zesco will also seek a total of $220 million from the Africa Development Bank (AfDB) and European Investment Bank (EIB) to develop the Ithezi-Tezhi power project, where 120 MW will be generated.Zambia generates 1,400 MW of electricity and consumes about 800 MW during the day, but demand rises to 1,500 MW at peak during the night.ZAMBIA-POWER/|LANGEN|AFN|Z|SF|ABN|C|MTL|D|DNPDocument LBA0000020091005e5a5000jo","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=LBA0000020091005e5a5000jo&cat=a&ep=ASE

This is good news for us and we will work towards improving the operations of the company,' he said.The minister said since the country's economy was growing, it would require a reliable railway line to match with the increased production of copper and agricultural activities in various parts of Zambia.He paid tribute to the Chinese Government for the support to Zambia's various development programmes and TAZARA in particular and that the loan would help the company operate effectively.He said a team of experts from China would soon be dispatched to work with the TAZARA management to evaluate its viability and to carry out a comprehensive study on how it could link other countries through the railway network.Prof Lungwangwa reiterated his Government's commitment to contributing to the development of the country through infrastructure development, among others.Last month Zambia, Tanzania and the Chinese governments met in China to discuss the possible funding of TAZARA.Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Li Qiangmin said he was confident the negotiating teams would reach a conclusion and reiterated his government's commitment to supporting Zambian programmes aimed at contributing to the economy.Mr Li said the financing of TAZARA was a clear testimony of the good bilateral relations that his country and Zambia have enjoyed over the years, which have continued to grow.President Rupiah Banda and his Tanzanian counterpart Jakaya Kikwete had earlier appealed to creditors to cancel TAZARA debts to rescue the railway firm from collapse.The two leaders further called on the board of directors to expedite the process of concessioning management and operations of the railway company to a competent railway enterprise from China.The railway line, built in the early 1970s through the assistance of the People's Republic of China, is seen as the icon of friendship between the three partner States, China, Tanzania and Zambia.The railway also facilitated the opening of trade links between Tanzania and other landlocked neighbouring countries.Document AFNWS00020100112e61c000gp","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Africa, regional, Tanzania, Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020100112e61c000gp&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"2421","China","Rail Project between Sebha and Misurata mines (Duplicate of 2278)","2008","false","'1428 words5 September 2008Middle East Economic DigestMEEDEnglish© 2008, Emap Communications. All rights reservedWith the cost of air travel soaring, Cairo, Tripoli and Algiers are finally taking steps to overhaul their dilapidated railway infrastructure after years of underinvestmentHugh TomlinsonUnlike Saudi Arabia, where three huge projects are set to give much of the kingdom a rail connection for the first time since the Hejaz railway at the beginning of the 20th century, North Africa has a legacy of rail from colonial times.However, much of that legacy has been squandered over the subsequent decades of underinvestment, to the point where national rail networks have largely fallen into disrepair or been abandoned completely.The region’s governments have now woken up to the fact that without functioning passenger and freight links around the country, their national rail infrastructure network is in danger of being permanently consigned to history. The high cost of air travel means it is out of reach for many, and fares are rising as fuel prices soar. Rail investment is back in the spotlight.Morocco already has good rail infrastructure, and its programme to upgrade its existing network to provide high-speed links between the kingdom’s major cities will bring the network up to the best of modern standards. Tunisia too boasts impressive road and rail links between its main cities, and the small size of the country makes further upgrades relatively straight-forward, so long as there is money to invest.But in the larger states that lie between the two countries, it is a different story. The old rail networks in Libya and Algeria have fallen into disuse, while Egypt’s 5,000-kilometre network is poorly maintained and has a poor safety record.Rebuilding plansAll three countries are now trying to turn the situation around. In February, Russian Railways was awarded a contract to build a modern rail transport hub in the Algerian capital Algiers. The project covers the rebuilding and upgrading of 14 suburban stations, the dismantling of 58.5km of existing tracks and laying about 95km of new line, the electrification of 52km of track, and associated works including a 38km telecommunications system and the construction of a modern rail control centre.Libya, which has had no railway in operation since 1965 after the old narrow-gauge system fell apart in the years following the Second World War, is now capitalising on its substantial oil wealth to build a multi-billion-dollar network from the roots up.'We have no rail in Libya, not even one metre,' says one official at the government’s Railway Executive Board (REB). 'We need new railways to develop the economy of the country.'Libya’s readmission into the international community has prompted a new impetus to improve the country’s tourism infrastructure. There are plans for a railway running the entire length of Libya’s Mediterranean coast, from Tunisia to the Egyptian border.This year alone, it has taken several huge steps forward. Earlier this year, China Railway Construction (CRC) and Russian Railways were awarded the two construction packages on the $4bn high-speed rail project along Libya’s Mediterranean coast. The Chinese will build a double-track, high-speed line between Khoms and Sirte, while the Russian firm will continue the line to the country’s second city, Benghazi.CRC will also build a $1bn, 800km minerals railway running north to south between the mines near Sebha and Misurata on the coast. Once the line is complete, products will be transported rapidly and in bulk. As with the North-South railway in Saudi Arabia, the line should dramatically increase the speed and capacity of the country’s minerals export business.Improving tradeThe new network 'will improve trade links to Tunisia and Egypt and the minerals railway will improve industry in the country,' says the REB official. 'We want to bring more tourists to the country and the railway from Tripoli to Benghazi means they can travel along the coast.'The proposed extension of the high-speed track from Khoms to the capital is still in the design phase, but the REB says it hopes to issue a construction tender for this package by the end of the year. With France’s Aeroports de Paris starting work on a $1.3bn refit of Tripoli International airport, Libya is at last building an integrated transport system to support the country’s embryonic economic redevelopment and diversification plans.However, questions remain over whether Libya has sufficient engineering expertise within the country to plan and roll out this network. 'Libya, like the Gulf, has a lot of money at the moment,' says an official at one Western contractor closely involved in the North African market. 'What it has not got is the level of expertise to deliver on projects of that kind at the moment.'However, there are factors that work in Libya’s favour. 'Tripoli to Benghazi is mostly flat stony desert, so it should be fairly easy to deliver,' says the contractor. 'If they hand these projects over to foreign contractors on a turnkey basis, it is possible they could bring that expertise in.'The REB is aware of its skills shortage and has issued a tender to find an international consultant to supervise construction on each of the rail packages under way. The companies appointed will work alongside Germany’s De-Consult, which has been working closely with REB for the past four years.'We would like to bring in three consultants, one for each project: Khoms to Sirte, Sirte to Benghazi and Sebha to Misurata,' says the official.Sourcing financeThe REB hopes to appoint a separate consultant for each of the three sections of the rail project by early November. Another tender was issued in early August for the design of a 450km, high-speed line between Benghazi and Tobruk, close to the Egyptian border, which is likely to cost close to $2bn.Unlike the billions being spent across the border in Libya, Cairo has chosen to renovate existing lines rather than build new ones. However, the £E5bn ($932m) budget for this is unrealistic at a time when the cost of delivering major infrastructure projects is rising worldwide. In a sign of the times, a recent tender to overhaul the 1,300 level crossings along the Egyptian rail network is to be retendered after the bids came in substantially over budget.'The infrastructure in Egypt is in a very poor state,' says one source close to the bidding process. 'There is old equipment in use on the commuter lines and safety issues everywhere. There are 1,300 official crossings, but certainly many more than that. Egypt has a densely populated countryside down the Nile. This means you have farm traffic crossing all over the place. The cost of upgrading this is going to be huge.'Egyptian Railways (ER) and the Transport Ministry are looking around for new sources of revenue. World Bank funding of £E500m is being sought for work on the country’s signalling systems, and ER is planning to offer packages of railway stations for privatisation. A contractor buying them will be able to build commercial facilities on the surrounding land in exchange for redeveloping the stations themselves, an approach used with limited success on the Tehran Metro.There has also been talk of new, privately financed lines, including a high-speed link between Cairo and Alexandria, and one from Cairo to the Red Sea, but investors have so far shown little appetite for the proposals. Plans for a new £E3.5bn railway between Obour City and 10th of Ramadan City appear to have stalled while ER reviews the financing of the project.'The issue is how to make it attractive to investors,' says the source. 'Can they rely on traffic volumes? If they rely on the Egyptian public, they cannot raise fares high enough.'A further problem the government faces is how to develop and retain staff of sufficient quality throughout the network.'Egypt Rail employs about 80,000 staff, and drivers are only earning about $100 a month,' says the source. 'The ministry needs to raise salaries, but is faced with the same problem as in other areas: how to slim the workforce at a time when unemployment is already high, to increase the wages of those critical staff.'Algeria, Libya and Egypt will all face substantial challenges in the years ahead as they endeavour to revamp rail networks that have fallen into varying degrees of disuse and disrepair. But each has taken the first step along the way.Document MEED000020080908e4950000x''222 words27 November 200807:56 AMReuters NewsLBAEnglish(c) 2008 Reuters LimitedTRIPOLI, No 27 (Reuters) - China Railway Construction Corp has begun building a 2.2 billion dinars ($1.70 billion) railway project in Libya, Libyan state media said on Thursday.The 453 kilometre railway line will link the capital Tripoli with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's coastal home town of Sirte, and would connect Libya's factories and plants to its ports, Libyan state news agency Jana said.The railway line is part of a major Libyan plan to build a railway network linking it to other African states, including neighbouring Maghreb countries, Jana added.Other foreign companies, including one unnamed Russian company, would be involved in the North African state's countrywide railway plan, alongside the Chinese company, whose involvement marks the latest foray by a Chinese company into Africa.China has been aggressively seeking trade and investment ties with a number of African countries in an effort to tap into energy and natural resources to help feed its booming economy.Libya is one of China's largest trading partners in Africa, with two-way trade estimated by Libyan officials at more than $2.0 billion during last year.

The total contract value of the three rail projects is $4.24 billion, of which $3.55 billion worth of construction has not been completed, the firm said on Tuesday.The contract value of the uncompleted work in Libya accounts for 2.3 percent of its overall portfolio of unfinished jobs. The firm won bids in 2008 to build a 352-kilometer west-to-east coastal railway and a south-to-west railway that would facilitate the transportation of iron ore from the southern city Sebha to Misurata.Its third project is a 172-kilometer railway that extends from Tripoli, Libya's capital, to the key Ras Jedeir port in the west, the firm said.Eergrande predicts net income riseEergrande Real Estate Group Ltd's net income for the year ended Dec 31 may have a 'significant increase' from a year earlier, the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Wednesday, without giving details.Shimao to issue $350m notesShimao Property Holdings Ltd said on Wednesday it would issue $350 million senior notes due 2018, raising capital to finance redemption of a floating rate note and to repay other debt.In a filing with the Hong Kong bourse, the Chinese property developer said proceeds would also be used to finance existing and new property development projects, and to enhance liquidity.The notes will carry an interest rate of 11 percent per annum payable semi-annually.

"13387","China","Chinese health training/missions in Guinea [commitment year before 2000]","2011","false","Diplomacy: the state of the Chinese-Guinean cooperation on the eve of the opening of the fifth joint bilateral commission of cooperation of the countries in Conakry.The fifth session of the joint grand commission of bilateral cooperation between China and Guinea will take place in Conakry on 13 and 14 April 2011. The high powered delegation led by the Chinese deputy minister of trade, Fu Ziyinc, which will take part in the discussions, is arriving by a special flight from Peking on this 13 April for a session which is beginning with the visit to the construction site of the 50,000 seating capacity stadium at Nongo and the commissioning of the Kipe International Hospital which are both donations from China.According to the technicians at the Ministry of International Cooperation of our country, 'the Chinese-Guinean diplomatic ties which date back to October 1956 and the dominant characteristics of which are discreet, are achieved mainly through interest free loans, completed by financial grants, donations of food and pharmaceutical product, budgetary aids and military assistance'. Several accomplishments are also among this cooperation on the level of agriculture, industry, handicraft, infrastructure, trade, energy, health, education, training and telecommunications among others. They are achievements that contributed greatly to the socio-economic development of Guinea.On the education level, for instance, China gave Guinea 300 scholarships in the areas higher and post-university education and in the fields of architecture, mathematics, food technology, biochemistry, agriculture and health in the last 13 years. However, in the case of health, 22 Chinese medical missions have been circulating between Conakry, Labe, Faranah and N'Zerekore on the basis of a biannual renewable contract from 1968. The training of over 140 health workers of all categories is also in this programme.On the trade level, statistics show that commercial exchange between our two countries which were up to the tune of 43m dollars in 2002 rise to about 200m dollars currently. With the admission of Peking in 2004 into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Chinese authorities gave a quota of 87 products to Guinea from the following year under special customs preferential tariff treatment.It should be noted that Guinea received from China in cash and kind a total sum of nearly 7m dollars from 1984, under the terms of this donation, for the purchase of rice seeds, tractors, learning materials for the deaf and dumb, building and telecommunications materials and fertilizers etc.Under infrastructures, the Sekhoutoureya Presidential Palace, the Kinkon and Tinkisso hydroelectric plants, the Kipe International Hospital, the People's Palace, the RTG [state-owned Guinean Radio-Television] Broadcasting House at Koloma, the Chinese-Guinean Friendship Schools at Coyah, the 50,000 sitting capacity stadium at Nongo which is being built are among the showpieces of this cooperation.We should note finally that about 40 Chinese technical assistants are currently working on various Chinese-Guinean cooperation projects, without speaking of the multitude of Chinese private companies which give birth to a massive presence of Chinese nationals in our country.It is therefore in this favourable atmosphere that the discussions on the fifth session of the Chinese-Guinean joint grand commission of bilateral cooperation is opening on Wednesday [13 April], which is the harbinger of bright prospects for the deepening and diversification of this over five decade old cooperation based on a win-win policy.Source: Guineenews website in French 12 Apr 11adaa7181Document BBCAP00020110413e74d002e5","Health","health training/aid","","Completion","3","Free-standing technical assistance","Unset","","Guinea","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020110413e74d002e5&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"2485","China","Chinese to invest billions in South Africa ","2003","false","AFRICA: CHINESE TO INVEST BILLIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA By Varsha Gupta d'Souza 495 words 10 October 2003 Inter Press Service IPRS English (c) 2003 Global Information Network JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 10 (IPS/GIN) -- China is planning to invest billions of rand in South Africa, according to a trade delegation from the province of Guangdong. Not only is China going to pump in large amounts of money, but it is also widening its investment fields. After focusing on road and railway construction, agricultural machinery production and farm produce processing over the past 40 years, the Chinese will pursue their interest in projects in industries which range from consumer electronics to petrochemicals and the smelting of metals. And this is expected despite the strong rand, both South African industrialists and trade and industry department officials feel. 'I am quite enthusiastic about the response of South African trade officials,' said Amalgamated Appliances CE Jack Cohen, who was one of the hosts to the Chinese, and whose own company does extensive business with the Guangdong-based TCL Corporation. 'I was very excited to hear about the government incentives for major investments. This visit has opened up a great area of opportunities between Guangdong and S.A.' Cohen said that his company imported components for television sets from TCL, and expected this business would amount to R150 million to R200 million (about $21 million to $28 million) this year. 'We expect to be bringing in other products by next year, including cellphones, air conditioners and white goods (kitchen appliances),' he said. 'But TCL is not only looking at S.A. buying from them; there is a two-way interest, and they are very serious about the potential of investing here. This will depend on how seriously S.A. trade department officials follow up on this visit. 'However, they could be looking at even bigger things, such as smelters. The $2.2 billion figures for the planned aluminium smelter at Coega didn't frighten them.' TCL president Dongsheng Li said he wanted more co-operation with South Africa 'and we believe we can also have success in S.A'. Guangdong's Vice-Governor Ningfeng You said he expected more Guangdong enterprises to invest in South Africa 'I firmly believe there must be more economic and trade co-operation.' The Guangdong delegation was briefed on the free trade access which South Africa has to the E.U. and U.S. markets, and might invest in South Africa to benefit from this preferential access to these markets where there is already great nervousness about the growing economic might of China. South Africa trade officials said they had been encouraged by the interest shown by the Chinese, and would be pursuing potential investments. Justice Minister Penuell Maduna met the Guangdong delegation, and pointed out South Africa's strategic position as a gateway for Chinese investors into Africa. He suggested that a clear message from the recent abortive World Trade Organization meeting in Cancun was that developing nations were hoping for a shift in world trading power in their favor.

"2521","China","Loan to boost high-speed internet infrastructure (Duplicate)","2006","false","javascript:oid(0)javascript:oid(0)Uganda gets $106 mln China loan for optic network By Tim Cocks 272 words 30 May 2007 12:22 PM Reuters News LBA English (c) 2007 Reuters Limited KAMPALA, May 30 (Reuters) - Uganda has secured a $106 million loan from China to build a national fibre-optic network to improve its strained communications system, the east African nation's government said on Wednesday. Chinese firm Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] will construct the backbone, which telecoms and Internet service providers will be able to rent, Technology Minister Ham-Mukasa Mulira said. 'We're delighted,' he told Reuters by telephone. 'We'e been looking at building a fibre-optic backbone for a while. The Chinese government was very kind to offer (this loan).' Mulira said he did not know the exact conditions of the loan, only that it was on 'ery soft terms'. China has been wooing African countries with aid and loans as it seeks greater access to the continent's raw materials and consumer markets to feed its fast-growing economy. Mulira said Uganda approached China with the idea at an unprecedented Sino-African summit in Beijing last November, when President Hu Jintao hosted African leaders and promised billions of dollars in aid and debt write-offs. 'China was looking at where they could assist in the development process. In Uganda, one idea was IT,' he said. Uganda's existing voice and data services struggle to keep up with demand, with slow Internet speeds and frequent dropped calls. '(The backbone will) bring access to voice and data at high speeds,' Mulira said. 'It is like digital road infrastructure: anyone can use it.'  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Internet Cable Project Stoppedby Cyprian Musoke475 words21 April 201009:38 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2010 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedKampala, Apr 21, 2010 (New Vision/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE National Information Technology Authority has stopped the laying of the Internet cable over reports of poor quality and inflated costs.The three-phase project, which was meant to be ready by now, has been mired in controversy since it started in 2006.The cable is meant to be linked to the submarine cable that arrived at the East African coast recently and to provide faster and cheaper Internet access to Uganda.However, experts say the project will not deliver on the objectives because of the poor quality of the cable. Experts also said Uganda was spending far more on the 'inferior' cable than what Rwanda spent on a superior one.In a letter to the Chinese firm, Huawei Technologies, which is implementing the $106m (about sh221b) national fibre-optic project, the ICT watchdog said the work should wait until a forensic audit is conducted.The permanent secretary of the ICT ministry, Dr. Godfrey Kibuuka, said the audit was goung on, but refused to give details.The head of the parliamentary committee on ICT, Igeme Nabeta, also said yesterday the MPs had ordered the Chinese company to stop to allow a review of their work to ensure value for money.'Where we find that they made mistakes they have to fix them at their own cost,' he stressed.He said they would like to see the first phase operational before they give the project a greenlight.'We want to see those e-government services operational.' The first phase involved laying a cable covering Kampala city, Entebbe, Mukono and Bombo towns, to enable high-speed data transfer between government offices.Under the project, 2,100km of backbone fibre-optic cable would be laid. The New Vision broke the story recently that the cable was largely defective and inadequate for the national backbone infrastructure.Uganda, it emerged, was using the G652 type instead of the G655 which would enable fast transmission and to take care of future growth.The project is funded by a concessional loan from the export/import bank of China. Uganda will pay back the loan over 20 years.'The contractor had transferred the completed phase to the Government. In some parts, the cable was laid in swamp land, elsewhere there are no generators, and many trenches are too shallow,' the MPs said in a report.Despite the order from Parliament and the ICT ministry to halt the second phase, Huawei refused to stop.Huawei blamed the damage to the cable on the numerous dig-ups in the city by various companies installing underground infrastructure.Huawei wants each party to appoint its own experts to establish the quality of their work and said it was ready to fix any errors which they are responsible for.Document AFNWS00020100421e64l000sa------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Country to Miss Digital Deadline1335 words1 September 201104:02 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2011 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved...Backbone out of whackOther Huawei projects in Uganda have run into problems. Uganda's Auditor General found fault with the management of the $106-mn. national fibre-optic backbone roll-out, citing cost overruns, inferior equipment and sloppily-installed infrastructure. The 2,100-km. project is now three years behind schedule. The government, including Parliament and the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Ministry, asked Huawei to stop work in April 2010 so that a forensic audit of the $30-mn. first phase could be completed after it was revealed that the fibre being installed would struggle even to meet current usage needs. The audit report also says that Huawei laid cables in swampland and buried lines in shallow trenches, so they are subject to damage when roadworks are carried out.Huawei blamed local utility companies for digging up the lines and said that the delays were due to the government's tardiness in setting up the National Information Technology Authority. Only the first phase of the three-phase project - to link Kampala to Bombo, Entebbe, Jinja and Mukono - has been finished. The first phase was implemented without a supervisory authority from the government to ensure the quality of the work.In late July, State Minister for ICT Thembo Nyombi said the government had hired an independent auditor to probe the Huawei backbone deal to see if the government had got value for money on the stalled project. Completion of the second and third phases, which will link 28 districts to the backbone, is expected to take about two years. The lack of planning is evident in the fact that northern Uganda was excluded from the three phases of the project, according to the Parliamentary ICT Committee, which noted that the project cost two to three times more than similar projects carried out in Uganda and Rwanda. Despite Huawei's problems in Uganda, Warid Telecom hired the company for the installation of its third-generation network in June.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Suspended","4","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Uganda","http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=LBA0000020070530e35u001hy&cat=a&ep=ASE

"2487","China","China, Africa stengthen ties --- Package of 14 deals valued at $1.9 billion competes with West","2006","false","China, Africa strengthen ties --- Package of 14 deals valued at $1.9 billion competes with West By Andrew Batson 705 words 6 November 2006 The Wall Street Journal Europe WSJE 9 English (Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones   Company, Inc.) BEIJING -- Leaders from China and 48 African nations, wrapping up a summit unprecedented for its size, announced a new type of partnership intended to strengthen links between the developing world's biggest economic-success story and some of its poorest nations. This weekend's gathering in Beijing has drawn global attention to an increasingly significant trade-and-political relationship that has the potential to eclipse Africa's historical reliance on Western-led development institutions and former colonial powers. China is unapologetic about its need for African resources to supply its booming economy, but its leaders also point to the construction projects, technical training and low-price goods it is bringing to Africa. 'In this new era, China and Africa share increasing common interests and have a growing mutual need,' Chinese President Hu Jintao said in a speech. At a business forum yesterday, Chinese and African enterprises signed 14 business deals valued at a total of $1.9 billion, including contracts to build a rural telephone system in Ghana, construct an aluminum factory in Egypt and build a highway in Nigeria, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Mr. Hu, signaling that China isn't acting purely out of self interest, promised to provide Africa with $5 billion in preferential funding in the next three years. China also will double its aid to Africa and cancel some debt owed to China by the poorest African nations, he said, though Mr. Hu didn't put a value on either commitment. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz have both publicly welcomed the summit meeting, saying there is much Africa can learn from the economic overhauls in China that have lifted hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty. 'Economic cooperation should be at the core of the renewed Sino-Africa strategic partnership,' said Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. Messrs. Hu and Meles, with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, read a declaration calling for strengthening China-Africa ties on a basis of 'political equality and mutual trust.' Total trade between China and Africa has been increasing at 30% a year and is expected to top $50 billion this year, up from $39.7 billion in 2005. Resources and raw materials dominate the relationship: Angola this year surpassed Saudi Arabia as China's largest supplier of crude oil, and the scale of China's purchases means the country runs a trade deficit with Africa. The economic links are even broader than those figures suggest. Chinese engineering companies have built thousands of miles of railways and highways across Africa, and are expanding. China Civil Engineering Construction Corp., a state-owned company, said last week it signed a $8.3 billion deal to build a 1,315-kilometer railway between the Nigerian cities of Lagos and Kano. It said the project is the largest international construction project by value ever undertaken by a Chinese business. For African countries, whose chronic lack of infrastructure has stunted their economic expansion, such deals are attractive -- especially when China's government-backed banks also can offer inexpensive financing. And China gets credit for being willing to work in war-torn countries where others fear to tread. 'Chinese investment is crucial to us because we have destroyed everything' in the civil war, said George Wallace, the foreign minister of Liberia. Critics say such munificence is just a way for Chinese firms to get a leg up over competitors in the scramble to lock up Africa's resources. China has also been willing to trade with regimes, like those of Sudan and Zimbabwe, that have been criticized in the West as repressive. The rapid expansion of economic ties has sparked tension. China became an issue in September's elections in Zambian elections after workers at a Chinese-owned copper mine rioted over low wages and poor working conditions. South Africa's textile industry has asked for restraints on Chinese imports, saying local producers are being driven out of business by the flood of inexpensive China-made goods.

"11142","China","US$100 million credit line (duplicate)","2009","false","Feb 10, 2009 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE Peoples' Republic of China signed another grant agreement with the Namibian Government yesterday, this time for 50 million Yuan (N$65 million). It brings the total funding from China since Independence in 1990 past the one billion Namibia dollar mark. More aid is in the pipeline, such as the upgrading and expansion of the Namibia Defence Force (NDF) military school to a full-fledged Defence Academy for around N$65 million and the construction of a youth training centre for about N$130 million. According to Chinese Ambassador Ren Xiaoping, the use of the new grant will still be decided on. 'The projects to be funded by this new grant will be negotiated between our two countries,' Xiaoping said. She added that China was fully paying for the construction of the presidential residence at the new State House. 'This is a pure grant and construction will be completed by September this year.' China is about to build a school at Omuthiya and a hospital for the Namibian Government. Two more schools will be built at Tsumkwe, while an aquaculture research centre was recently completed near Divundu close to the Okavango River. Since Independence China has given Namibia two grants of 30 and 50 million Yuan, an interest-free loan of 30 million Yuan and one billion Yuan as a concessional loan. The Director General of the National Planning Commission, Dr Peter Katjavii, yesterday said that Government launched its third five-year national development plan (NDP3) last November which required some N$76 billion. 'While a large part could be secured, it still leaves a gap of N$11 billion in potential resources that need to be mobilised.' Asked what happened to the US$100 million (N$1 billion) credit line offered by Chinese premier Hu Jintao during his state visit to Namibia in February 2007, Katjavii replied that this had not yet been utilised. Ambassador Xiaoping said the credit line might possibly be used to upgrade and expand the port of Walvis Bay, which will cost approximately N$1,3 billion. In response to a question about complaints of low wages by Namibian workers employed by Chinese construction companies, and northern businesses worried about being pushed out of business by Chinese retailers, Katjavii said this 'issue is being shared with our Chinese friends and addressed by our line ministries'. 'I am aware of a recent report on a survey about this issue but I am not in the full picture,' he said. Last week, Works and Transport Minister Helmut Angula told a meeting at Keetmanshoop that the Chinese government was pushing for Chinese workers to do construction work in Namibia. 'They cannot work with African workers since they have a different culture,' Angula said. According to him, the Chinese government believes that Namibian construction companies do not have the capacity to take on large projects like the rehabilitation of the final 47 kilometres of the Aus-Luderitz railway line. Namibia has no money left for that project, which will cost N$70 million, and is negotiating another soft loan to complete the rail link upgrade. 'The bone of contention is whether to allocate the tender to a Chinese or Namibian company,' Minister Angula said.","Other (see notes)","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan Guarantee","Unset","","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020090211e52b0002v&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Several accomplishments are also among this cooperation on the level of agriculture, industry, handicraft, infrastructure, trade, energy, health, education, training and telecommunications among others. They are achievements that contributed greatly to the socio-economic development of Guinea.On the education level, for instance, China gave Guinea 300 scholarships in the areas higher and post-university education and in the fields of architecture, mathematics, food technology, biochemistry, agriculture and health in the last 13 years. However, in the case of health, 22 Chinese medical missions have been circulating between Conakry, Labe, Faranah and N'Zerekore on the basis of a biannual renewable contract from 1968.

"11974","China","construction of a National Sports School","2007","false","Dec 03, 2007 (The Post/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Chinese Government has pledged to construct five sports stadiums of international standards in the country.The governments of Cameroon and China signed a partnership accord on Friday, November 30, at the conference hall of the Ministry of Finance in Yaounde.According to the agreement, an ultra-modern sports complex would be erected at Olembe in Yaounde to be baptised Paul Biya Stadium and a stadium each in Douala, Garoua, Ebolowa and Bafoussam.Meanwhile, rehabilitation of the existing stadiums in each of the provincial headquarters would be carried out within the agreement. Both construction and renovation projects have been estimated to cost FCFA 272 billion, and would span for eight years during which the government of Cameroon is expected to refund the money to her Chinese counterpart.It was disclosed that each of the stadiums would be constructed to contain 60,000 spectators. Speaking shortly after the signing ceremony, the Director of China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation, Li Huaijun Chanxin, revealed that the construction of the Paul Biya sports complex would take three phases.The first phase would be to construct a 60.000 seats capacity stadium to be accompanied by an aquatic centre built to provide a chemical system comprising air conditioning among others. Still, this phase would also witness the building of a modern associated facility such as a hotel.The last but one phase of the work takes into account the construction of a 35,000 seats capacity of a National Sports School to cover some 10 thousand square metres of land with a medical rehabilitation centre for students to recover from physical activities.The sports school would incorporate an indoor gymnasium and an aquatic centre. Meanwhile, the renovation of provincial stadiums would constitute the last phase. It is estimated that phase one would consume EU 144,000 million; phase two would take EU 60 million while phase three is EU 209 million project.The Chinese construction company would provide only the expertise. Meanwhile, Cameroon labour began preliminary work at the site at Olembe since January this year.In a chat with The Post, Li Huaijun said his company would effect a modern lighting system that gives our national colours as it automatically changes from green to red to yellow in the night.He said both the energy and water supply in the complex would be the business of his company.It was also stated that the ability to carry out the work according to time is based on bi-lateral efforts of both Cameroon and China.Sports and Physical Education Minister, Augustin Edjoa, said Li's company was chosen based on its experience and know-how. He also made known that his team had spent nine days in the country during which they visited the construction sites and carried out budgetary estimation with finance experts from the Ministry of Sports and Physical Education and from their experts.Minister Edjoa disclosed that his Ministry has drawn up an elaborate plan to provide sports infrastructure in all the provincial headquarters. According to the plan, he went on, proximity sports edifices would be erected in all Divisional headquarters in the country. He said this development is in line with government's determination to see the country host the 2016 African Cup of Nations as well as other international sports jamboree.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020071203e3c3001y0","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Implementation","2","Unset","Unset","","Cameroon","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020071203e3c3001y0&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The deal was signed late Tuesday by President Francois Bozize, who is also defence minister, and He Siji, China's ambassador to Bangui. 'The Chinese army will supply the Central African army with logistical resources, military uniforms, communications equipment and other items,' He told the radio station. 'This is important because the country needs a strong army, and a strong army needs to be equipped,' he said. Tractors will be provided under the agricultural component of the accord, whose value was not revealed.

They resumed three years later when then president Ange-Felix Patasse broke off with Taipei.

The preliminary agreement, signed on 17 September 2007 by the Congolese minister Pierre Lumbi Okongo and the group ChinaEximbank/ China Railway Engineering Corporation/Sinohydro, represented by Li Changjin, CREC,’s chairman, a copy of which was obtained by AMI, covers the granting of mining concessions totalling 8.05 million tonnes of copper ores, 202,000 tonnes of cobalt and 372 tonnes of gold «to be identified» (sic). The document specifies the following concessions: the Mashamba basin (1 million tonnes of copper and 151,000 t of cobalt), the Dima basin (3.93 m t of copper and 49,000 t of cobalt), the Dik Colline D syncline (2 m t of copper) and Kolwezi (1.11 m t of copper and 1,076 t of cobalt). The agreement calls for the formation of a joint venture between the Chinese group and Congolese companies designated by Kinshasa which are not identified in the document. These companies would only own 32% of the joint venture. Financial costs of the deal will be covered in several stages: priority will first be given to the amortisation of the USD 3 billion mining investment, which is to be financed by the joint venture’s revenues; then infrastructure construction work will be financed to the tune of 66% by the joint venture’s net profits (the rest will be distributed proportionally between the parties); finally, with commercial production, all remaining investments will be amortised. The joint venture will be granted special conditions for supplies and public works contracts for a period of 30 years. The list includes cost exemptions for transactions such as demand for or award of mining rights, transfer or sale of mining participations or exploration and production permits, for example.'   '【星岛网讯】中国签署了一份协议草案，同意向刚果民主共和国[刚果（金）]提供50亿美元贷款，发展交通设施和采矿业。这项协议还将部分资金用于建设新的学校、医院和政府提供的住房建设。这将是中国在非洲最大的投资之一。 　　美国之音报道，在中国提供的贷款中，约有三十亿美元被规定用于交通建设，包括一条主要高速公路以及一条连接刚果南部的矿区中心和西部马塔迪港口的铁路。这笔贷款也将用来建设新的学校、医院和两所规模很大的大学。刚果基础设施部部长说，剩下的二十亿美元将用来发展刚果的采矿业，并启动中国和刚果的合资项目。 　　国际危机组织高级分析员贾森·斯特恩斯说，中国的贷款对去年底赢得里程碑式大选的刚果总统约瑟夫·卡比拉来说十分关键。他说：“卡比拉急迫地想以和平回报支持他的选民，但是他们今年困难重重，难以对当地老百姓的社会服务项目做出改变。” 　　斯特恩斯说，刚果的基础设施在过去三十年遭到破坏，简直是一片废墟，那里只有几条铺过的道路和一条破旧的铁路。他说，因为政府的财政状况缺乏透明度，许多国际投资者去年起减少了在刚果的投资。 　　此外，中国政府没有对贷款附加任何条件。刚果自然资源极为丰富，有钴、铜、锡、黄金、钻石和木材丰富的森林。这些资源的开采由于连年战乱而减缓。'   ","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Tied","4","Congo, Dem.

A company based in Hong Kong and related to China Sonangol (an alliance between Chinese capital and the Angolan State), CIF is particularly planning to revive the tram project in Antananarivo (ION 1297). The financial configuration of this future MDC is similar to that of the Société Sino-Guinéennede Développement which the CIF tried to found in Conakry (Guinea) at the end of 2009 when the country was under the thumb of President Moussa Dadis Camara. The sponsors of this Guinean company are the very same that are now trying to promote Sino-Angolan interests to TGV: the former Guinean Minister for Mines, Mahmoud Thiam, a close friend of his Malagasy opposite number, Mamy Ratovomalala, and the International Football Federation (FIFA) player agent Amadou Diaby. These two men went to Antananarivo several times, where they were received by TGV and his advisors. According to Africa Energy Intelligence (sister publication to The Indian Ocean Newsletter), China-Sonangol is planning, via their intermediary, to recover the oil search permits that the Malagasy State is trying to revoke from Madagascar Oil.Thiam and Diaby also took a Frenchman along with them: Gilles Wertheimer, a businessman who may already have participated in building a military hospital in Guinea with Chinese funding. Via his company Alliance International Partners, whose Africa representative is Diaby, Wertheimer offered TGV to build several pre-fabricated hospitals, thereby enabling him to keep promises he had made during the campaign for the constitutional referendum last year. Wertheimer estimates that this construction work could be financed by levying $10 million on the amount paid by the Chinese company Wisco to obtain its contract to work iron ore at Soalala.87610343|XMLExtract_ION_1301.xmlDocument IOLET00020110204e71m0000s","Health","military hospital","","Completion","3","Unset","Unset","","Guinea","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=IOLET00020110204e71m0000s&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"14224","China","Chinese company interested in Ugandan refinery (Not a project)","2009","false","Uganda to woo China money for energy, infrastructure533 words4 November 200908:19 AMReuters NewsLBAEnglish(c) 2009 Reuters Limited* Wants investment in nuclear energy, high-speed rail* Chinese investors already interested in refineryBy Elias BiryabaremaKAMPALA, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Uganda intends to woo Chinese investment to boost the country's efforts in adding value to exports and to tackle energy and infrastructure handicaps, government officials said.China's commercial footprint has been expanding in Uganda over the last five years. It was the third biggest FDI source in the third quarter of 2009 after India and Britain, according to the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA).'Our prime economic interest in China is if they can invest in our processing industry, infrastructure and energy, including nuclear energy, as the president has emphasized in the past. That would be a good partnership,' President Yoweri Museveni's spokesperson, Tamale Mirundi, told Reuters.He said Museveni plans to attend a China-Africa Summit in Egypt later this month. Trade between the continent and China has grown at 30 percent a year, climbing to $107 billion in 2008 to eclipse the United States for the first time.Museveni has previously named modern, high-speed railways and a refinery for Uganda's newly-found petroleum deposits as some of the immediate projects the Chinese can invest in.Landlocked Uganda still depends for a great deal of its external trade on the derelict and inefficient Uganda-Kenya rail line to get its exports to sea, blunting the goods' competitiveness and stifling economic growth.The volume of trade between Uganda and China remains relatively small and heavily imbalanced in favour of China.Uganda imported goods worth $274.2 million from China in 2007 compared with 138.2 million in 2006, according to a Uganda Bureau of Statistics report that did not give export figures.REFINERY FOR UGANDAN OILA delegation from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China -- which holds a 20 percent stake in Standard Bank, Africa's biggest bank by assets, -- met Museveni in June and said it was interested in a partnership for the refinery.Uganda is locked in a dispute with the exploration companies Tullow Oil, Heritage Oil and Gas of Canada over whether the country should refine its petroleum, an option the government prefers, or export crude.The east African country has estimated reserves of 2 billion barrels and levels are forecast to grow substantially over the next few years.'The exploration companies don't want us to refine our oil but we're saying no. The president thinks the Chinese can come in with their vast expertise to help us acquire refining capacity,' Tamale said.Uganda mainly exports cotton, leather, coffee, fish, and minerals to China and buys textiles and garments, footwear, porcelain, enamel, mechanical and electrical goods.Keith Muhakanizi, a top Treasury official, told Reuters that Uganda was targeting China's huge investment funds.China has 'enormous investment funds capable of undertaking huge infrastructure projects in energy and infrastructure and these are the areas where we're focusing our efforts,' he said.

The drugs were officially handed over to health state minister Dr. Richard Nduhura on Friday.This is the fourth donation of anti-malarial drugs from the Chinese government at the request of Uganda in an attempt to cut down on the estimated 320 daily deaths caused by malaria.According to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, between 70,000 and 110,000 annual child deaths are due to malaria.Handing over the consignment, the Chinese ambassador to Uganda, Sun Heping, said medical care and health were a priority in the China-Africa cooperation.'African people have long been plagued by malaria. To help them improve health care and enhance the capacity to prevent malaria, treat it and deliver better health services to the people, China has intensified its efforts to cooperate with African countries in the field of health over the past three years,' Heping said.He also commended the good relations between Uganda and China. China is constructing a hospital and malaria research centre in Naguru, a Kampala suburb.'We will also continue to provide Uganda with medical equipment and anti-malarial resources to improve the capacity for diagnosis and treatment, and to ensure that China aid projects are sustained to better serve Ugandans.'Nduhura thanked the Chinese government for continued support to Uganda in many fields, including the construction of the Naguru hospital.Malaria accounts for 40% of Uganda's public health expenditure.The Government is distributing free treated mosquito nets to households and introduced free anti-malarial drugs to its health centres across the country to contain the disease.Document AFNWS00020101011e6ab0007n","Health","hospital and malaria research centre","","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Uganda","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020101011e6ab0007n&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Technical experts from our two countries will consult on this,' he said.President Mwanawasa said the Zambian Government had signed a letter of intent with Sinohydro Corporation, among other companies who are interested in investing in the energy sector, especially in the hydro power plant projects in Kafue Gorge Lower for 600 megawatts and in the Itezhi Tezhi for 180 megawatts.Another agreement was signed with the municipal people's government of Quindao on the establishment of the Mulungushi industrial park as a joint venture project.Quimdao Kailan group of companies also signed an agreement for the establishment of a chemical fertiliser and pesticides project at a cost of US$ 10 million with an expected production of 200,000 tonnes and 10,000 tonnes, respectively.Meanwhile, President Mwanawasa says he has not yet received a report on the revocation of title deeds from Minister of Lands Judith Kapijimpanga and Copperbelt Minister Webby Chipili by the lands tribunal.Responding to a query, Mr Mwanawasa said he was yet to be briefed on the matter before he could make a decision.The lands tribunal in its ruling on Monday revoked titles for a commercial plot jointly owned by the duo through their companies Pineland Investment and WC Engineering.The two ministers have since indicated that they would be appealing to the Supreme Court against the decision of the tribunal, which was chaired by Mr Sebastian Zulu.","Multisector","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Grant (excluding debt forgiveness)","Unset","","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=AFNWS00020031128dzbd000tp&cat=a&ep=ASE

The local workers as well as most customers neither speak English nor Chinese or Mandarin. Equally the supermarket managers hardly speak any English and know nothing of the local language, yet this store opens every morning and is apparently doing brisk business.The Mukwano Shopping Arcade, a large circular two-storey arcade opposite the main taxi park in downtown Kampala, is a beehive of activity with people of all walks of life squeezing for space. The shops here teem onto the verandas and the vendors, who started on the verandas, are pushing more into the road already crammed by the 14-seater minibus taxis that is the common transport in Kampala.The traders that mix here are a medley of all nationalities from Congolese traders to South Sudanese and Kenyans. But recently traders say they have noticed a new competition, not just increasing volumes of cheap Chinese-made products but of Chinese traders dealing exclusively in 'Made in China' products. At night when the crowds reduce, Chinese families that have set camp on the two top floors are a common site, staring down at the large open yard that turns into bars.This same situation can be said of many towns in Uganda as is the case of Fort Portal - the penetration of China seeking new markets and opportunities for its billion plus population has spread wide and deep across the African continent.At this year's Uganda Manufacturers Association (UMA) Trade Fair at the Lugogo Show Grounds, some 70 odd Chinese companies exhibited. Industrial players said these largely constituted 'new opportunity' seekers and less of already established businesses.'Chinese are investing both downtown and uptown; they are everywhere,' says Mr Awel Uwihanganye, the chief executive officer of the Uganda National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Mr Uwihanganye says he is amazed that in the few months he has been at the chamber, he has experienced a sheer volume of Chinese delegations, traders, and officials seeking opportunities in the country.'It is true China is engaging with Africa heavily,' he says.Mr Dennis Kawuma, the Business Editor at the Independent newspaper, the Daily Monitor, which is part of the Nation Media Group says; ' if you were to use South Africa-the biggest economy in Africa- as a bellwether, it is obvious that Chinese influence is growing on the continent. Today, China is South Africa's largest trading partner.'In Kampala, Fang Fang Restaurant was the flagship enterprise opened in the upscale Nakasero suburb by an enterprising woman, Fang Min, more than 15 years ago for Kampala's choosy A' Class clientele.Today another branch has opened but more importantly is 'Chinese Restaurants' are becoming a common site with new ones of various grades to cater for various clienteles are opening almost all over town.Just like the open market where China is chasing customers like any other trader to efforts to woe government monies, China's aggressiveness is the same. Large Chinese construction companies are in the countryside opening new highways at multi-billion dollar contracts. The Chinese construction firm, SBI rebuilt a 75-kilometer stretch of tarmac road from Fort Portal to Kasese Town just after they had completed a longer, over 100 kilometer Mbarara--Kasese Road through Bushenyi District.The construction firm is now working bitumen on a $152 million Kabale--Kisoro road project near the Rwandan and Congolese borders.Mr Kevin Chen, the CEO of a $15m digital TV investment project, Star Times, says China's aggressive drive into Africa is driven by largely two factors; the money for capital investment and the technological knowhow.'The driving force now is capital; we have the money, enough capital and because of this we have to look for investment opportunities to make more money,' says Mr Chen, adding rather brusquely; 'China is opening up and expanding. When you open up you have advantages, for a long time we were closed but now we are opening.'Because of the sudden turn-around, Chinese investors are not blind to the challenges of infrastructural inadequacies in Africa, as Mr Chen says the potholes might be a menace but not as bad and, therefore, tolerable. He, however, notes that intermittent power supplies and a high cost of fuel to run diesel engines coupled with erratic mobile telephone networks still present major obstacles.Does China care about political stability? Mr Chen says it does, especially for its investment projects.'(Political) stability is important, now it is difficult for Chinese investors to go into a country such as Libya. Uganda is much more stable.'Investment is not like trading, Chen says, but the Chinese are doing both here and elsewhere. The numbers have grown so big in a very short period of time that recently, a Chinese event was held at the five-star Kampala Serena Hotel.Pioneer Chinese investor Fang Min, who arguably opened the door for Chinese investment and trade in Uganda, is seen here as an iconic figure. Her country even honoured her on its postage stamps.When Chen begins to reel off Chinese businesses in Uganda at the snap off the finger--his countrymen are into steel rolling and are exploring investing in mineral exploration and expanding into the hospitality industry more aggressively than the cautious Fang Min.Mr Uwihanganye says China is pushing in all directions and, in his view, appeasing African governments with not only cheap credit but large construction projects.Evidence abounds to vindicate this view. The Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is housed in a gleaming six-storey block donated and constructed by China.Two new towers that will house the President's Office are nearing completion on a plot between the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) and Parliament and overlook the ministries of finance and foreign affairs. The two towers dwarf all the other buildings.In nearby Lugogo, a new hospital is nearing completion to ease the pressure on the country's only national referral hospital, Mulago.Mr Uwihanganye says government seems to have been blinded by apparent extreme Chinese generosity to put any checks. There are hardly any local partnerships between the Chinese investors and local people; they are taking all.'They are finding a culture which is too liberal, which does not require them to partner,' he says, noting that Africa has not learnt from the experiences of exploitation first by colonial invaders and later by Indian and Asian business people who invest and repatriate all their profit while keeping closed communities of their kith and kin without integrating into the local communities.But China has been willing to engage, to negotiate without putting conditions like their western rivals who put human rights and governance as key to their aid or pre-conditions they wave at their companies seeking opportunities in Africa. China is also not know for issuing sometimes distabilising advisories to its citizens venturing into Africa, a position many African leaders fancy as they battle to re-assert their authority in the post-independence era.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020111018e7ai000g3","Unset","","","Unset","","Unset","Unset","","Uganda","

"16347","China","China, SA to boost economic/trade cooperation","2007","false","647 words7 February 2007Xinhua News AgencyXNEWSEnglish(c) Copyright 2007 Xinhua News AgencyPRETORIA, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- China and South African agreed on Tuesday to view and develop bilateral ties from a strategic perspective and push forward their strategic partnership based on equality, mutual benefit and common development.Visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao and his South African counterpart Thabo Mbeki held talks here on Tuesday afternoon, at which they reached broad consensus on future development of bilateral relations.Hu said China firmly stood alongside the South African people during their struggle against apartheid and that the Chinese-South African ties have enjoyed fast, multi-facet and all-round growth since the two countries established diplomatic ties 10 years ago.The two countries have had fruitful bilateral cooperation in economy and trade, science and technology, education, culture, tourism and justice, he noted.Hu expressed China's appreciation for South Africa's adherence to the one China policy and its support for China's reunification cause.During the talks, Hu put forward a five-point proposal for further promoting China-South Africa ties, including ways of boosting political mutual trust, deepening economic and trade cooperation, expanding the scope of bilateral cooperation, increasing people-to-people contacts and intensifying multilateral cooperation.To build up political mutual trust, Hu suggested that the leaders of the two countries keep frequent contacts and have in-depth exchanges of views on major bilateral and global issues through both bilateral and multilateral channels.On economic and trade cooperation, Hu suggested that both sides optimize trade structures and create an environment conducive to the healthy growth in bilateral trade.He also proposed to explore ways to expand cooperation in vocational training, Chinese language teaching, infrastructure, mining, energy, information technology and crackdown on crimes.To boost people-to-people contacts, Hu announced that the Chinese government will invite 500 young people from South Africa and other African nations to visit China in the next three years.On international issues, Hu proposed that both countries enhance multilateral cooperation and safeguard common interests and said bilateral cooperation should also be enhanced within the framework of the United Nations and other multilateral organizations.Expressing his appreciation for the endeavors made by South Africa to resolve internal conflicts in Africa, Hu said China will continue to support and participate in peacekeeping operations in the region.For his part, Mbeki said South Africa and China have established a solid friendly and cooperative relationship and both countries share the resolve to enhance their bilateral strategic partnership.Through concerted efforts of both sides, the South African-Chinese relationship will be further consolidated and developed, Mbeki noted, adding that he fully agreed with Hu's proposals to advance the strategic partnership between the two countries.Economically, China is one of South Africa's most important partners; politically, the consultation and cooperation with China is an asset to South Africa in meeting various challenges, he stressed.China's attention to and cooperation with Africa is of great significance for the rejuvenation of the African continent, he said.Mbeki hoped that both sides will deepen cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, technology, agriculture and natural resources, and increase people-to-people contacts.He applauded China's determination and actions to implement measures adopted at the Beijing Summit of the Forum of China-Africa Cooperation last November, saying the African people have been encouraged by China's follow-up moves.After the talks, Hu and Mbeki witnessed the signing of five documents on bilateral cooperation in economy and technology, plant quarantine and other fields.Hu arrived in Pretoria earlier Tuesday from the Namibian capital of Windhoek for a three-day state visit to South Africa.South Africa is the sixth leg of Hu's current eight-nation African tour that has already taken him to Cameroon, Liberia, Sudan, Zambia and Namibia. Hu will also travel to Mozambique and Seychelles.","Multisector","Economic, trade","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","South Africa","http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=XNEWS00020070206e327007vo&cat=a&ep=ASE

It was the start of a tour of Africa, where China foreign ministry officials have traditionally started the year in a sign of the importance they place on the resource-rich continent.Yang was also to visit Congo, Burundi and Ethiopia.Yang said the China-South Africa relationship is 'of great importance,' the South African Press Association reported.Since South Africa, the continent's economic powerhouse, dropped Taipei for Beijing 10 years ago, China has become the country's largest trading partner.Trade between South Africa, the continent's economic powerhouse and a major gold-producing country, and China reached US$240 million in the first 11 months of 2006, an increase of 34.5 percent from the previous year.Last year China's biggest bank, the state-owned Industrial   Commercial Bank of China Ltd. bought a 20 percent stake in South Africa's biggest lender, Standard Bank Group Ltd. in one of China's biggest foreign corporate acquisitions to date.Chinese investments into South Africa amount to US$130 million, mostly in a chromium mine while South African investments in China stand at about US$400 million including investments by Anglo American, SAB Miller and a US$120 million investment by a property group.Yang's visit comes a year after Chinese President Hu Jintao visited South Africa in early 2007.South Africa and China on Monday established a diplomatic mechanism to enhance political, economic and trade relations.Yang and Dlamini Zuma were also expected to discuss co-operation between the two countries in international affairs as well as Chinese support for peacekeeping operations in Africa.7Document APRS000020080107e41700378","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","South Africa","","0","Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), State-Owned Company","","Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), State-Owned Company","1","Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd., Private Sector","1","Raw","0","OOF-like","3","Unset","","Inactive","2","","","","","","","","","","","1","South Africa","560","218","South Africa","ZAF","ZA","710","199","Commercial","1","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

"16688","China","(Pre-2000) President Mugabe Inaugurates Sino-Zimbabwe Cement Plant","2001","false","HARARE, October 26 (Xinhua) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on Friday officially inaugurated the Sino-Zimbabwe Cement plant in Gweru, about 300 kilometers south of Harare.Speaking at the opening ceremony, Mugabe disclosed that at present, the plant has a production capacity of 700 tons of cement per day and it is expected to achieve full capacity by January 2002 when it will produce 900 tons per day.He also said that the project has created employment for 215 permanent and 109 contract workers.Under a joint venture agreement between Zimbabwe's Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and the China Building Material Industrial Corporation for Foreign Economic-Technical Corporation (CBMIC) in June 1994, the cement plant was completed in September 2000 with a total cost of 51 million U.S. dollars.Among those present at the opening ceremony were Zimbabwean Minister of Industry and International Trade Herbert Murerwa, Minister of Finance and Economic Development Simba Makoni and ChineseAmbassador to Zimbabwe Hou Quingru.Document xnews00020011026dxaq004u2---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Construction - Zimbabwean cement industry in crisis533 words16 February 2003Economist Intelligence Unit - Business AfricaEIUBFBusiness AfricaNumber: 304English(C) 2003 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.Zimbabwe's cement industry is on the verge of closure because of inadequate coal supplies. United Portland Cement (Unicem) stopped production at its Colleen Bawn plant in mid-February while Circle Cement, a subsidiary of France's Lafarge group, suspended sales and deliveries early in the month because it had no stocks. The firm comments that rail- delivered coal supplies have been 'erratic and inadequate' since mid-2001. While a number of alternatives have been investigated, including the use of road transport, the cost is 'totally prohibitive,' especially when the government has imposed controls on the sale price of cement.Unicem, a subsidiary of South Africa-based Pretoria Portland Cement, says Wankie Colliery has been unable to supply coal because of production and loading problems at the colliery as well as an inadequate supply of rail wagons. Unicem adds that the supply of fuel from local sources has 'virtually stopped,' forcing the firm to import its own diesel fuel.It adds that since price controls were imposed on cement in August 2001 it has been allowed only one price increase -- of 50% -- while input costs have escalated by 500%. 'At current controlled prices the industry is no longer viable,' it says.Between them Circle and Unicem account for some 90% Zimbabwe's cement production, some of which is exported, mostly to neighbouring Zambia. Such sales have proved controversial, since the state media claims that Circle Cement continues to export to Malawi, and that domestic cement deliveries have been suspended because of price controls rather than the coal shortage. Circle denies this, however, and points out that the country's newest and smallest supplier, Sino-Zimbabwe Cement -- a joint venture between a Chinese group and Zimbabwe's state-owned Industrial Development Corporation -- has also suspended production.No funds for maintenanceLast month the country's sole coal producer, Wankie Colliery, said it was operating at 50% of capacity. It has not been able to source adequate foreign currency to repair and maintain the dragline at its open-cast mine, which produces 85-90% of its coal. 'More than half of major mining equipment is on breakdown' according to Wankie. As a result, the firm's ability to supply coal to the country's Hwange Thermal Power Station has been 'severely compromised'. Coal deliveries are also constrained by the inadequate supply of railway wagons from the state-owned National Railways of Zimbabwe, which is providing only 55% the agreed 150 wagons per day. Wankie is using road transport to send out some 45% of its deliveries, but this is very costly and suitable only for smaller products.The cement shutdown is likely to hit the construction sector, while it is only a matter of time before the coal shortage gives rise to load-shedding by the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA); this will have knock- on effects across industry and mining. ZESA has warned industry that power shedding will become necessary from April onwards. Other construction- related businesses are being affected. Turnall Fibre Cement, which makes asbestos sheeting, says it is now sourcing some of its products from South Africa.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","cement plant","","Suspended","4","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=xnews00020011026dxaq004u2&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"16760","China","Duplicate: Energy and Minerals Deal","2010","false","CAPE TOWN, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping signed an energy deal with resource-rich South Africa on Wednesday in a visit aimed at obtaining minerals the Asian giant needs to fuel its blistering growth.China is South Africa's biggest bilateral trading partner and the focal point of its plan to divert more trade and investment from traditional markets in Europe and North America to the world's fastest growing economies.Xi, touted as China's next president, on Tuesday began a three-day visit to Africa's largest economy, which is seeking to reduce a deficit in trade with China that hit $2.7 billion last year, skewed in Beijing's favour.South African Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe and Xi co-chaired the 4th China-South Africa bilateral commission and signed a number of agreements, including an energy deal.No monetary details were released.'The Chinese government undertook to encourage more imports from South Africa, especially value added products and will urge Chinese companies to invest in infrastructure development, automotive manufacturing, energy and information and communication technology,' Motlanthe said in a statement.South Africa has also signed a deal with China's Yingli Solar to build a $435 million manufacturing plant with a local partner, a senior government official said.Yingli will partner with a local company and aimed to start building the plant within 12 months.South African exports about $5.5 billion a year in minerals to the state and has been increasingly a destination of Chinese foreign direct investment.BRICSA?Beijing sees South Africa, a global mining power and regional financial services leader, as a vital source of commodities and a stepping stone to access other African states.Motlanthe said the help of countries including China is vital for South Africa's new economic growth path, which aims to create millions of jobs, mainly in the private sector.For South Africa, China also serves as a model of state action in the economy, with Pretoria hoping to join it in the BRIC -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- group of fast emerging economies.But a 'BRICSA' grouping seems unlikely for now with South African growth projected at 3 percent this year, hardly the blistering pace of the other members. Its economy is also less than a quarter of the size of the smallest BRIC economy.South Africa's ruling African National Congress has rolled out plans to tackle a massive unemployment problem, with many ANC officials seeing the success of the BRICs as evidence that the state should intervene more.But experts said the ANC, in a governing alliance with organised labour, is loath to loosen a rigid labour market to make it easier for its companies to hire and fire staff with the ease of Chinese firms.'There are things to be learned but that can only come if one is willing to listen. Around labour policy, there is no translatability of a China or U.S. approach to labour and labour flexibility,' said Martyn Davies, CEO of Frontier Advisory and an expert on Africa-China relations.

This is testimony to our increasing co-operation with China,' said Lt. Gen. Sibanda.He urged the ZNA personnel to look after the vehicles properly.Trade and economic co-operation between Zimbabwe and China has grown tremendously.Under the partnership with China, several joint venture companies have been established in the country.China also remains the biggest buyer of Zimbabwes tobacco.Under the Zimbabwe-China Joint Commission, Zimbabwe has benefited through the Chinese Governments concessionary and interest free loans and grants.Document AFNWS00020050113e11d0018m","Military","","","Completion","3","In-kind contribution","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020050113e11d0018m&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Estimates suggest that China will collect up to US$20 billion, or 50%, of the estimated US$40 billion-worth platinum supplies in Zimbabwe. The government of Zimbabwe was represented by the Minister of Finance, Tendai Biti; the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono; Minister Tendai's chief adviser, Conrad Nyamoruva; Ministry of Finance official Mary Takavarasha; the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Edward Mashiringwani, and Governor Gono's chief adviser Munyaradzi Kereke. A singular July 4, 2009 report from Zimbabwean media outlet ZimEye suggests, contrarily, that no such agreement occurred in the first place. A 2011 report stated that Eximbank's offer was for $3 billion rather than $5 billion. It also suggested that the deal was still being discussed, and no formal agreements had been made.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Tied","4","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020090706e576000p1&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved.>> >>A Chinese company, the China Roads and Bridge Corporation, has been awarded the contract to build or rehabilitate the 371 km highway between Kifangondo in the metropolitan region of Luanda and the town of Negage in the northern province of Uíge, via the the city of Caxito (Bengo Province). The announcement of the award was made by the Angolan National Roads Institute (INEA), which is overseeing the US$211 million project. According to O Apostolado, the first phase is focusing on the 58 km stretch between Kifangondo and Catete. Work on this stretch is reported to have begun last week. The entire project should be concluded within 27 months.>> >>Significance: The Luanda-Uíge road rehabilitation will be crucial to the revial of coffee production and copper mining in the northern provinces, which has been largely moribund since the outbreak of the civil war in 1975 and has shown few signs of recovery since the end of the conflict in 2002. The project also highlights the growing role of Chinese investment in Angola. The road rehabilitation programme is financed by the US$2 billion credit line provided by the Chinese Eximbank on extremely cheap terms. Under the agreement, Chinese companies must be awarded 70% of the resultant construction work, a small price for the Angolan authorities to pay for a loan so unburdened by conditions. The Chinese loan facility will be the main source of income for the Angolan government's public investment programme in coming years. Although the facility will hopefully improve the overall infrastructure and growth performance in the economy, it also has been the catalyst in the Angolan government's recent spat with the International Monetary Fund (IMF; see Angola: 16 February 2005: Angolan Government Unable to Comply with IMF Criteria). The substantial loan facility from China has opened up the opportunity for the Angolan government to ignore the IMF's loan conditions, so it remains to be seen if issues between the two parties can be resolved in the coming months (see Angola: 20 April 2005: Angolan Finance Minister Downplays IMF Disagreement). '>> >>'Luanda, Angola, 27 June – Chinese state company China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which is rebuilding 371 kilometers of the national road linking Kifangondo (Luanda), Caxito (Bengo), Uíge and Negage (Uíge) in Angola, is due to finish work in June 2008, officials told Angolan news agency Angpop.>> >>The project, work on which began in December 2005, is estimated to cost US$211 million.>> >>So far 140 kilometers of the road have been de-mined, which is the first stage of work required for rebuilding to go ahead.>> >>The rebuilding project, which involves over 3,000 Angolan and Chinese workers, includes 12 bridges, 10 of which will be new, and also requires over 200 aqueducts to be built.>> >>One of the main aims of the reconstruction of this road is to re-launch agricultural activities in the region.

"133","China","Duplicate: Malarial Research centre in Abidjan ","2011","true","See ID# 716Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)Abidjan, 16 August: The problem of poverty is a big challenge for Africa and the fight against this scourge has been the main preoccupation of most governments on the continent.Most analysts have observed that China has been deeply involved in the fight against poverty on the continent besides African governments. China has also remained faithful on the side of the continent as witnessed in a number of initiatives that have been launched in various sectors.Among African countries, Cote d'Ioire is one of those which have benefited a lot from China's support and help.In the health sector, taking the case of malaria as an example, the means to fight against the disease have been reinforced in Cote d'Ioire thanks to Sino-Cote d'Ioire cooperation.Through collaboration with Cote d'Ioire's health ministry, the Chinese government has put up a research centre in Abidjan which will help in the fight against malaria. The Cote d'Ioire authorities have said that this malaria research centre came at the right time and it will help to improve the health status of the population.'Malaria is a real health problem in the country and it represents the first reason for medical consultations in our hospitals. A centre offered by a friendly nation (China) will help to relieve the pain of most of our people,' Patrice Konan, a doctor at a hospital in Abidjan, said in a recent interview with Xinhua.The impoverization of the people comes not only through the deterioration of health conditions, but also through food deficiency.Cote d'Ioire has also received support from China in her efforts to achieve food sufficiency through production of foodstuffs like rice.In March this year, China which is the biggest rice producer in the world gave Cote d'Ioire authorities over 200 tons of fertilizers and hundreds of agricultural machines whose cost was evaluated at 2 million euros.Still, following the appeal from Cote d'Ioire for the Chinese support on the strategies for reviing rice farming, a Chinese delegation of experts visited several Cote d'Ioire localities in 2010 to train rice farmers.The Chinese delegation in Cote d'Ioire was led by Director of the International Center for the Fight Against Poverty (LPRCC) Wu Zhing.'There's need to take advantage of the Chinese experience in order to increase food production,' a Cote d'Ioire investment expert Raymond Sibailly said recently.'The IPRCC is one of the biggest global institutions involved in the fight against poverty. This center also works with the universities of China and through its actions, this country has achieved miracles in the fight against poverty,' Sibailly said.The problem of housing is another big challenge for Cote d'Ioire. In the country, most of the people do not have decent houses to live. In most towns, there's a problem of slums which house the jobless people or those who earn little wages. Most families live in makeshift houses because of poverty.In order to help resolve the housing problem, China has partnered with the Cote d'Ioire government in the construction sector to try and reduce the housing shortage.During a recent meeting with a Chinese construction company, Cote d'Ioire Prime Minister Guillume Soro called for concerted efforts with Cote d'Ioire's Construction and Housing Company (SICOGI) to ensure that majority of the people live in decent houses.Recently Cote d'Ioire experienced a post-election crisis which resulted in the loss of lives and destruction of property. Soon after the crisis was over, the country's President Alassane Ouattara announced that reconstruction of the country would be one of his main priorities.China has expressed its willingness to help Cote d'Ioire in the reconstruction process.After several preliminary meetings with Cote d'Ioire's authorities during which the Chinese emissaries promised support from their country, Sino-Cote d'Ioire agreements regarding Chinese aid for Cote d'Ioire's post-crisis reconstruction were signed in June this year.Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhai Jun and Cote d'Ioire's Foreign Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan signed the documents which granted Cote d'Ioire loans and cancellation of Cote d'Ioire's debt.In addition, China has also given Cote d'Ioire 'urgent materials' worth 1.09 billion Fcfa.China has honoured the commitments she made to Cote d'Ioire.'The crisis increased poverty in Cote d'Ioire. The Chinese contribution is expected to help in the revial of activities in some of the country's sectors,' said Emmanuel Lohoues, an official at Cote d'Ioire's finance ministry.'On the path of development, Cote d'Ioire will always have China on her side,' Zhai promised.Chinese Ambassador to Cote d'Ioire Wei Wenhua has on several occasions reiterated his country's willingness to help Cote d'Ioire on her development path.Source: Xinhua news agency, Beijing, in English 0644gmt 16 Aug 11","Unset","","","Unset","","Unset","Unset","","Cote D'Ivoire","http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BBCAPP0020110816e78g0030d&cat=a&ep=ASE

The Souapiti dam should allow the former French colony to generate some 750 MW of electricity, officials said. Guinea is one of the world's least developed countries and even parts of the capital city have only sporadic mains power.A senior Chinese government delegation visiting Guinea had confirmed that China's government-owned Export-Import Bank (Eximbank), which has invested in projects across the world's poorest continent, would fund the dam.Local media reported that in return, Guinean authorities would guarantee China access to mineral reserves equivalent to some 2 billion tonnes of bauxite, the raw material used in the production of aluminium.'To guarantee Chinese investment, you have to give them guarantees but nothing has yet been formally decided,' said Cece Noramou, a senior official in Guinea's mines ministry.'They are interested in bauxite but we haven't finished determining the tonnage and so on,' he added.China has been offering low interest loans, debt relief and other incentives to countries around Africa as it seeks to increase its influence on the continent and gain access to natural resources to feed its fast developing economy.Guinea is the world's top bauxite exporter but most of the population survie on less than $1 a day.The Chinese delegation also promised debt relief worth around $4 million and an aid package of $5.2 million, according to Aboubacar Cisse, a spokesman for Guinea's foreign ministry.He said China had pledged to renovate the People's Palace cultural centre in Conakry and the state radio and television centre, partially destroyed when a Guinean air force jet crash-landed on it in April.GUINEA-HYDROPOWER/CHINA|LANGEN|G|RBN|Z|AFN|AFA|CSA|LBY|RWSA|RWS|REULB|GNS|RNP|DNP|PGE|SXNADocument LBA0000020070707e377000dj----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Souapiti Dam: Beijing Gets Way With Package273 words18 July 2007Africa Mining IntelligenceAMIN160EnglishCopyright 2007 Indigo Publications All Rights ReservedAs they did with the Belinga iron mine in Gabon the Chinese got their way in Guinea’s bauxite sector after several years of lobbying: tstyle='BACKGROUND-COLOR:#FFFF00'>hey are to undertake an integrated program worth over USD 1 billion that includes construction of a dam, bauxite mine and an aluminium smelter. On July 2, a delegation from China’s Export Import Bank turned up to present the package to the minister for economic and financial controls, Saidou Diallo. The Chinese are to be awarded deposits containing over two billion tons of bauxite ore in return for financing construction of the Souapiti hydro power dam and building an aluminium facility. style='BACKGROUND-COLOR:#FFFF00'>The Souapiti dam is to generate 94 MW and be linked to the Kaleta and Amaria mines (an application for the hook-up is being examined by Conakry). Some of the 2 billion tons of ore covered by the agreement will come from concessions already awarded to the Chinese in the Fria and Telemele regions.But other licenses of better quality, located at Boke, will also be turned over to the Chinese next year after properties are relinquished in the region by BHP Billiton, RusAl, CGB and IMIDRO. Management of the bauxite resources will be seen to by Chalco while Sino Hydro is to build the hydro dam by 2012. China’s deputy foreign minister, Zhai Jin, was still in Conakry on July 7 to negotiate the bonus for the package: the write-off of USD 45 million in debt, renovation of the Palais du People and the Radio Television Guineenne between now and October.31129145Document AMIN000020070824e37i00002----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Eximbank Floored by Competition !

According to our information, Eximbank sought to impose too many conditions as guarantees of its investment. Among other things, style='BACKGROUND-COLOR:#FFFF00'>it demanded some of the revenue that Conakry gets from the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG) as well as 2 billion tonnes of superior quality bauxite (with alumina content of 60% or more) ! These conditions were judged unacceptable by the Prime Minister, Lansana Kouyaté, and the Minister for Mines, Ahmed Kanté, particularly as CBG’s revenues have been used to buy heating oil, rice and sugar for the country via an account with BNP Paribas since Kouyaté became head of the government. The Prime Minister therefore favoured encouraging another company to become involved in the project.The managing director of Cogon, Ahmed Tidjane Diallo, brought a group run by Sinozonto Mining Investment Co. Ltd backed by China Development Bank to Guinea to take the reins of the project. The grouping, run by Sun Jimming, is negotiating, among other things, taking on the bauxite bloc that had been allocated to China Eximbank at Fria. Sinozonto proposes building all the hydroelectric dams on the Konkouré, not only Souapiti, but also Kaléta and Amaria. It expects to commence bauxite production in 2010 and electricity production in 2012. Feasibility studies will begin between 2011 and 2012 for building an alumina refinery and then, depending on the availability of reserves, for construction of an aluminium smelter.34927882Document AMIN000020071130e3be0000k------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------New Chinese Group Formed for Souapiti - Conakry118 words28 November 2007Africa Mining IntelligenceAMIN168EnglishCopyright 2007 Indigo Publications All Rights ReservedIt seems that the removal of China Eximbank and its partners Chalco and Sino-Hydro from the integrated bauxite-alumina-aluminium development project linked with the Souapiti dam (AMI N°167) is confirmed. style='BACKGROUND-COLOR:#FFFF00'>On November 16, the government’s “new” Chinese partners, Hongpeng Sinozonto Mining Investment Co Ltd and Shanxi Luneng Jinbei Aluminum Corporation, formed Luneng Sinozonto Aluminium Guinea, a locally registered subsidiary.

The mission had come at the request of President Ahmed Abdallah Sambi and had been guided by the Union of the Comoros Minister for Energy Houmadi Abdallah, a native of the island of Anjouan. It had offered to supply four 1.6 MW electricity generators and 40 km of cable to the island of Ngazidja, two 1.6 MW generators and 40 km of cable to Anjouan and two 800 KW generators plus 30 km of cable to Mohéli. After the delegation left a dispute broke out between the government of Ngazidja and the island legislative assembly on one hand and the Minister Houmadi Abdallah on the other hand. The former accused the latter of having sidelined them from the meetings with the Chinese experts.According to the Ngazidja MPs, the original Chinese idea was to install an electricity power station on Grande Comore, but the office of President Sambi and Houmadi Abdallah had “denatured” this project “to the benefit of Anjouan and Mohéli” where the energy situation is nevertheless less alarming than on Ngazidja”. Hoping to calm down the debate, Houmadi Abdallah stated that “the Chinese proposal can only be put into effect after approval by the government of the Union”. The MPs were furious and insisted that the government of the Union ask the Ngazidja authorities for their opinion on this matter.33143440Document IOLET00020070921e39800006'","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","In-kind contribution","Unset","","Comoros","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=IOLET00020070921e39800006&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"469","China","Suez Free Trade Zone (Duplicate)","2002","false","Cairo, 18 April: Egyptian Prime Minister Ubayd said emphatically here recently that Egypt and China share a long-standing history of friendly exchange; and the two countries have achieved notable results in cooperation in various fields in recent years. He expressed the belief that through the joint efforts by the two governments and the two peoples, the two countries will have a still brighter future in the development of their relations. Chinese State Council Premier Zhu Rongji will begin an official visit to Egypt from 19 April at the invitation of Egyptian President Mubarak. In an exclusive interview with the Xinhua News Agency on the eve of Premier Zhu Rongji's visit, Prime Minister Ubayd said that both Egyptian and Chinese Governments have always attached great importance to developing bilateral relations; and that the top leaders of the two countries have exchanged visits frequently. President Mubarak has visited China eight times thus far, while the Chinese leaders have visited Egypt on many occasions. During President Mubarak's visit to China in January this year, the two countries signed a total of five documents, including an agreement on economic and technical cooperation, an agreement on cooperation in peaceful use of atomic energy, a framework agreement on cooperation in the field of petroleum, and a memorandum of understanding on implementing the proposal on Chinese citizens' group tours in Egypt. Thanks to the joint efforts by both sides, bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have become stronger and stronger; and the two countries have achieved fruitful results in economic, trade, military, agricultural, and tourism cooperation. Ubayd said: Remarkable progress has been made in bilateral trade and economic relations in recent years. The volume of two-way trade has increased by a big margin year after year, while Chinese investments in Egypt have also increased considerably. He said: Located in an important geographical position, Egypt enjoys domestic political stability and has a vast market. The Egyptian government has adopted a series of measures designed to improve the investment environment, to build up confidence in the Egyptian market among foreign entrepreneurs, and to attract more foreign capital. Ubayd believed that there exist vast vistas for increasing bilateral trade and improving the structure of trade and economic exchange between the two countries. In addition, the two countries also have great potentials for cooperation in the fields of petroleum, agriculture, banking, insurance, tourism, and ocean shipping. Progress has been made in China's participation in the construction of Egypt's Suez Canal Free Trade Zone. He added that there are broad prospects for cooperation in science and technology; and the two countries can work together in organizing technical seminars, and strengthen contacts and exchanges of scientific research personnel.

(CMEC) recently inked an agreement in the Republic of Gabon to develop the country's Belinga iron ore deposit, according to a CMEC announcement released on July 7.Under the agreement, a Chinese consortium lead by CMEC, with financial support from the Export-Import Bank of China, will establish a joint venture with Gabonese partners to construct and operate a 30 million-ton per annum iron ore mining facility, as well related infrastructure.Infrastructure will consist of two railway lines stretching approximately 500 kilometers in total, a deep-water port and a hydropower dam, which along with the mining facility, will require total investment of approximately EUR 450 million ($706.63 million).The mining facility is expected to commence production by 2010, and CMEC has pledged to offtake the entire iron ore output from the joint venture, state-run Shanghai Securities News reported July 8.CMEC defeated competitor Vale, the Brazilian iron ore miner, in a June 2006 auction for the mining rights to the Belinga iron ore deposit, which boasts an estimated 1 billion tons of iron ore reserves at a grade of 64 percent.CMEC, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Machinery Industry Corporation (Sinomach), specializes in overseas engineering contracting as well as in the import and export of machinery. //State-owned China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (CMEC) has signed an agreement with the government of Gabon to develop a iron ore mine in the African country, the official Shanghai Securities News reported. The parties will set up a joint venture to run the Belinga mine, which is expected to produce 30 mln tons of iron ore annually, the paper said. Total investment on for the development and exploration of the mine is expected to reach more than 790 mln usd. The company will also build a 500 kilometer railway, a water power station and a deepwater port, it added. The Export-Import Bank of China will finance the project, according to the paper. kelly.zang@xfn.com//Ask the Chinese to finance and expand even further the Sishen-Saldanha rail link? In Gabon, the Chinese are building the link between the Belinga iron-ore deposit and the port of Santa Clara, plus the associated power station and port facilities as well.//The government and the Chinese consortium led by the China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CMEC) have signed a convention specifying new regulations for the exploitation of the giant Bélinga iron ore deposit in the northeast of the country. Bélinga holds an estimated 1bn tonnes of iron ore with 64% purity. The project has progressed more slowly than was originally expected after the signing of the first memorandum of understanding (MoU) in 2006, in part because of disagreements over shareholdings in the project. After several months of intense discussions, a convention signed in December 2007 granted the Gabonese state a 25% stake in the company responsible for exploiting the deposit, Compagnie Minière de Bélinga (Comibel). Technical specifications have been another apparent source of tension: following the signing of the first MoU, the government believed that the works could be completed by 2012 (that is, before the scheduled presidential election).","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Cancelled","0","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Gabon","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=CHNMET0020080725e47b00001&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

In a communique signed here on Tuesday, the two leaders expressed satisfaction over the healthy and steady development of China-Gabon ties since the two countries forged diplomatic relations three decades ago. They vowed to maintain the exchange of high-level visits between China and Gabon, step up cooperation in various fields and increase consultations on African and international affairs. Gabon voiced support for China's reunification. It reiterated that there is only one China in the world, with the government of the People's Republic of China being the sole legal government representing China as a whole and Taiwan being an inalienable part of China. Both sides said that they will boost trade and investment, continue to support cooperation between enterprises and make sure the implementation of the signed cooperation agreements. They said cooperation will be focused on agriculture, infrastructure construction, resources exploitation and personnel training. China reaffirmed its willingness to render support within its ability for Gabon's economic and social development. The two countries agreed that in a world undergoing complicated and profound changes, peace and development remain to be the two major themes of the present times and the common aspiration of the peoples of all countries. They called for more international consultations to maintain diversity of the world and promote exchanges among countries of different civilizations and development modes. In regard to the economic globalization, both sides called on the international community to adopt measures to help developing countries overcome difficulties and enhance their ability to achieve an independent, sustainable development and protect the environment. They also urged developed countries to shoulder due responsibilities, expand access to their markets, remove trade barriers, and honor their commitments on financial and technological support and debt reduction and cancellation.     They said maintaining stability and alleviating poverty are twopressing tasks faced by African countries.   China supports the Africa Union and sub-regional organizations  in Africa in playing a greater role in achieving peace and stability in the continent and promoting regional integration process. China also supports African countries in seeking development and prosperity through the implementation of the 'New Partnership Program for African Development.' The two sides stressed the importance of solving conflicts in Africa through dialogue, and called on the international community to care more about the continent's situation. China will continue to participate in the United Nations peace-keeping missions in Africa and provide support to peace-keeping activities of Africa's regional and sub-regional organizations. The two countries highly value the China-Africa friendship and cooperation and regard the 'China-Africa Cooperation Forum' as an important platform for China-Africa consultations and cooperation.     China and Gabon will strengthen cooperation within theframework of this forum and promote the China-Africa partnershipdesigned for full cooperation and common development.'

"646","China","Preferential loans, Export credits, and Special Fund","2006","false","'Although China's trade has been running a deficit against Africa in recent years, China still hopes to further expand its import from African countries,' Wen told 27 presidents and 6 prime ministers from Africa, as well as nearly 1,300 Chinese and African entrepreneurs at the gathering. Earlier Saturday, at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, President Hu Jintao made fresh pledges to facilitate bilateral trade and cooperation. He said China will double its aid to Africa by 2009, increase from 190 to over 440 the number of tariff-free import items from the least developed African countries having diplomatic ties with China. China will also provide 3 billion U.S. dollars in preferential loans and 2 billion U.S. dollars of export credits over the next three years and establish a special fund of 5 billion U.S. dollars to encourage Chinese investment in Africa. Calling these measures 'pragmatic and stimulative', Wen made five proposals to entrepreneurs from both China and Africa. He said both sides should work closer in service sectors, tourism, finance and telecommunications in particular, to cultivate new economic growth points and facilitate trade in a more balanced and healthier manner. He said China will encourage capable and reputed indigenous companies to invest in Africa and spread their technology and management experiences. 'African companies interested in investing in China are welcome, ' Wen said. African leaders attending the conference also called for expanding trade and promoting cooperation in the business circles. Ethiopian Prime Minister Ato Meles Zenawi said business communities could evolve into a crucial force to facilitate cooperation between China and African countries. Without solid support of civil collaboration, Africa-China cooperation may not flourish. Gabonese President El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba said Central Africa, a peaceful land with 130 million population, has gradually walked out of various difficulties and created a favorable environment for international trade and foreign investment. He believes China and African countries will find out new measures at the FOCAC Beijing Summit to further cement cooperation so as to upgrade their strategic partnership to a higher level.

But the country now plans to develop its underground resources including manganese, nickel, gold and diamond.A Chinese mining firm is negotiating with Cote d'Ioire's state mining company on a joint venture project to develop manganese in the country, Gbagbo said.'I hope such a cooperation can be carried out in other fields,' he said.Gbagbo is among some 40 African heads of state who have been invited to attend a summit on China-Africa cooperation in early November in Beijing, in which Chinese and African leaders will discuss how to strengthen Sino-African partnership. //State-owned CGM is affiliated with the China Geo-engineering Corporation under the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and engages in geological exploration and resource development.CGM's other mining operations include the Augaro-Damiscioba project in Eritrea, the TKC copper project in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a manganese project in Cote D'ivoire, a lead and zinc mine in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a gold mine in Shaanxi Province, a copper mine in Yunnan Province and the Gala gold mine in Sichuan Province.

"833","China","100-kilometre road (Duplicate)","2011","false","LILONGWE, Apr. 20, 2011 (IPS/GIN) - Driving through MalawiÆs capital, Lilongwe, it is difficult to miss the imposing building under construction in the city centre. It's the countryÆs first five-star hotel, 90 million dollars worth of well-appointed rooms, a state-of-the-art conference centre and 14 opulent presidential suites.The hotel is being built by the Shanghai Construction Company, a Chinese firm, and is one of numerous projects funded in line with a pledge of 260 million dollars of concessionary loans, grant and aid from China to Malawi to support development, including infrastructure.At a ceremony marking the completion of the main building and conference centre, China's ambassador to Malawi, Pan Hejun, said he expects the whole project will be completed by the end of the year.'This will attract more and more foreign tourists to Malawi and enable Malawi to host international conferences such as the AU Summit,' said Hejun.Chinese construction companies have been busy in Malawi. Parliament now operates from a grand new building which was opened in June 2010. That project cost around 41 million dollars.And this month Ambassador Hejun announced China will assist the Malawi government to construct a university of science and technology in the southern district of Thyolo, which, he said, will be ready in just under two years.'The university, which will accommodate more than 3,000 students with advanced facilities, will be one of the best universities in southeastern Africa, and will make great contributions to the national development of Malawi,' said Hejun.Relations growing steadilyChinese construction companies are also building a secondary school in Thyolo, and a 100-kilometre road between the northern districts of Karonga and Chitipa. The Asian nation has also promised to build a China-Africa Friendship School in Lilongwe, establish solar and biogas pilot projects and set up an agricultural technology demonstration centre.ChinaÆs presence in Malawi has been growing steadily since the two countries established diplomatic ties in December 2007, Malawi abandoning its links to Taiwan after 41 years. A memorandum of understanding covering industry, trade and investment was signed between the two countries in May 2008, committing China to help in increasing the productive capacity of Malawi in tobacco, cotton, mining, forestry, fertiliser production and in processing hides and skins.A 2010 report from MalawiÆs Ministry of Trade indicates that the value of trade between Malawi and China has doubled since 2007, reaching 100 million dollars in 2010, rapid growth, though still dwarfed by trade with South Africa, which accounts for just over 40 percent of Malawi's total trade volume of 3.2 billion dollars.MalawiÆs president, Bingu wa Mutharika, has declared himself satisfied with his government's relations with China. In an April speech at the laying of foundations for the planned university of science and technology, Mutharika said the Chinese projects come with 'no strings attached'.'The PeopleÆs Republic of China has demonstrated that they are good friends of Malawi,' said Mutharika.Some problemsThis year alone, Chinese nationals working in Malawi in construction or as traders have featured in a number of unwelcome headlines. In January, police at the international airport caught Zhang Xiang Quian trying to smuggle 3.5 kilogrammes of ivory bangles, curios and necklaces out of the country. The same day, Jennifer Li was arrested when she attempted to bribe police to release Zhang. The two - who both held senior positions with the Shanghai Construction Company - were fined and deported.In February, the owner of the China Superscope Media Company, Ning Naixing, was apprehended at the airport with 1.5 kilogrammes of ivory. Police assert the ivory in both cases originates from elephants poached in Malawi. The Ministry of Tourism issued a statement on Feb. 11 warning against trafficking of ivory.Chinese traders - who have established a firm foothold in the wholesale and retail sectors in Malawi - have also run afoul of the law. Businesswoman Yani Huang was arrested and fined for violating foreign exchange controls in November 2010, when she tried to leave the country with an undeclared $18,350. A few months earlier, another Chinese national was arrested trying to take $144,000 out of the country.Malawi is experiencing acute shortages of foreign exchange, leading to strict controls on the export of hard currency. This complicates life for Chinese traders who want to repatriate profits made in Malawi.Local traders are also anxious over competition from the new arrivals. 'Some are setting up small-scale businesses and competing with indigenous traders. They are making life difficult for us,' Maddy Gawani, a trader who runs a clothes shop in Lilongwe, told IPS. She said there are big Chinese-owned wholesale shops in LilongweÆs Old Town, a cheap area of the capital city.'Many items in the Chinese shops are cheap but not very durable. A lot of people now shop from the Chinese who bring in many things in bulk. We are not happy as local traders,' said Gawani.Relations between the new traders and their clients are sometimes tense as well. Last year, trader Chen Bo Wet was arrested in the lake district of Mangochi after he allegedly forced a woman he suspected of stealing from his shop to undress in the presence of other customers. Nothing was found on the woman, and he was arrested following complaints.Worst fears unrealisedWhen the memorandum of understanding on trade and investment was signed, local groups feared it would have a negative impact on the country.At the time, Mavuto Bamusi, the network coordinator of the Human Rights Consultative Committee (HRCC), which promotes human rights, including economic rights, in Malawi, said the evidence was that Chinese investment had harmed the interest of poor nationals in some countries.'We know that the Chinese usually bring in their own workers when they invest in poor countries and that they have been accused of dumping cheap goods on such countriesÆ markets. Civil society will be quick to raise an alarm if such malpractices happen here,' Bamusi told IPS.But the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions has been keeping a close eye on the situation. MCTU Secretary General Robert Mkwezalamba told IPS that when they first arrived in the country, Chinese construction companies either paid their Malawian workers below the minimum wage or paid them in kind - in the form of clothing, bicycles, maize flour and sugar. In some cases, workers were not provided with protective gear.'They were paying the Malawi workers just about $13 per month when the countryÆs acceptable minimum wage is $20. Some Chinese factories were locking up the workers [in their workplace] overnight,' said Mkwezalamba.But, he said, companies have responded to the MCTU's objections.'We have been asking them to change and they are accepting our demands,' he told IPS. 'We are also happy that the construction companies are transferring advanced skills to local staff.'

"770","China","(Not project specific) China is trying to lure the country away from Taiwan with a promise of US$6 billion in aid","2007","true","Text of report in English by Taiwanese Central News Agency website [By Rachel Chan] Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA) - Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang admitted Thursday that there are some 'unusual signs' in diplomatic relations with Malawi and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is on 'high alert' following reports that China is trying to lure the country away from Taiwan with a promise of US$6 billion in aid. Speaking to reporters after a swearing-in ceremony for newly appointed Representative to Hungary Stanley Kao and Representative to Jordan Lin Jinn-jong, Huang said that although the US$6 billion is a 'fictional, even astronomical figure, ' the MOFA 'cannot guarantee 100 per cent' that relations between Taiwan and Malawi will not waver. Very few countries can resist such temptation, therefore it is now crucial for Taiwan to keep communicating with the Malawian authorities, he said. Nevertheless, he went on, the government will not raise the stakes for Malawi, as doing so would be 'meaningless.' Noting that the 41 years of diplomatic relationship between Taiwan and Malawi is built up on bilateral cooperation and partnership, the MOFA hopes there will not be any changes and is striving to cement diplomatic ties, Huang added. Source: Central News Agency website, Taipei, in English 1034 gmt 27 Dec 07  (Adds Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmation, paragraphs 5-6) LILONGWE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Malawi has cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan after 41 years and established links with China, which has become a major economic power in Africa. 'We have decided to switch from Taiwan to mainland China after careful consideration on the benefits that we will be getting from mainland China,' Foreign Affairs Minister Joyce Banda told a press conference in the capital Lilongwe on Monday. She said Lilongwe and Beijing had formalised diplomatic ties effective Dec. 27, 2007. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said the island would break off ties with Malawi immediately and expressed regret China was continuing to lure its allies with financial incentives. 'It is with regret that the government and leaders of Malawi are unwilling to honour their promises to our government and have succumbed to China's evil forces,' Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. China's government and its state-controlled companies have invested billions of dollars in Africa in a bid to tap natural resources for the Asian giant's growing economy and build Beijing's political influence in the developing world. China's Foreign Ministry confirmed on their Web site that they have established ties with Malawi. The deal was signed in Beijing on Dec. 28 The Chinese Foreign Ministry statement was accompanied by a large picture of a beaming Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi shaking hands with a Malawian official. Malawian and Taiwanese media earlier this month said the southern African nation's government cancelled a meeting with Taiwanese officials, raising speculation Lilongwe might end diplomatic relations with the island nation in favour of China. Malawi has been Taiwan's diplomatic ally since 1966. China, which regards the self-ruled democratic island as its own, has tried to isolate Taiwan diplomatically offering financial incentives to its allies. Taiwan's hopes of maintaining relations with the southern Africa nation were dealt a blow recently when the government in Taipei said it could not match a Chinese offer to provide some $6 billion in aid to Malawi, one of Africa's poorest countries. Banda said she did not know how much money China would ultimately donate to Malawi. She said projects funded by Taiwan, including a highway that extends to the border with Zambia, were discussed with China and would not be affected by the change in diplomatic relations. The number of countries that recognise Taiwan has dwindled sharply since the United States, once Taiwan's biggest backer, formally recognised China in the wake of former U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 trip to China. The vast majority of the world -- some 170 countries -- recognise China in step with Beijing's 'One China' diplomatic stance.

"841","China","Titanium Deal (Not a project)","2005","false","'A Chinese company has expressed interest in buying titanium from Kenya. Jianchuan Group is interested in buying large quantities of the mineral deposits in the Coast to be mined by Tiomin Resources of Toronto, Canada. The Canadian firm was early this year granted a licence to exploit the mineral in a deal billed as one of the largest single foreign direct investments in Kenya. Representatives of the Chinese firm are in the country to assess the extent to which the company can rely on the Kenyan titanium - a mineral used as a vital component in the manufacture of a variety of products including paints, plastics and electronics. The Chinese company recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Tiomin, declaring its intention to buy the mineral that is found in large quantities in Kwale District. Yesterday, the Chinese company and Tiomin's representatives paid a courtesy call on the minister for Environment and Natural Resources, Mr Kalonzo Musyoka, in his Nairobi office. The minister said the Kenyan Government was keen to assist foreign companies willing to invest in the country. 'There are other minerals in this county. You will find it beneficial if you also take interest in them,' Mr Musyoka told the delegation that is scheduled to visit the mining sites today. Among those in the delegation is vice-director and senior engineer of Jianchuan Group, Qiao Fu-guin, and Tiomin Kenya vice-president and acting chief executive Ben Sassoon.Jianchun Group is a large firm with investments in paints manufacture, electronics, batteries, adhesives and detergents.It is among the many Chinese companies that have expressed keen interest in the Kenyan economy at a time when it is showing solid signs of growth.Others are Aucma Technologies, which recently launched an electronic assembling plant in Nairobi and ZTE Communications, with interest in information technology products and which has strengthened its presence in the country and plans to expand in the region.President Kibaki is currently visiting China, a trip which is widely expected to enhance business relations between the two countries.The Government gave the go-ahead to Tiomin Resources to begin mining after signing an agreement early this year. The signing took place eight years after the Canadian firm declared interest in the mineral.The company has been licensed to mine the mineral for 21 years, in a deal which prompted wide protests from villagers being moved to create room for the venture as well as environmental campaigners.Once the mining starts, the firm is expected to give 2,000 jobs to Kenyans and inject into the economy Sh400 million every year. However, the figures are largely seen as speculative.Indeed, there are disputes about the real value of the mineral deposits with the mining firm being accused of undervaluing it.The Canadian company puts the gross value of the entire Kwale titanium deposits at $1 billion (Sh76 billion) before upgrading it.However, a study by Alternative Approaches to the Mining of Heavy Minerals says that upgrading one of the constituent minerals, rutile, would raise this value to about $1.5 billion (Sh114 billion), besides generating between $2 billion (Sh142 billion) and $3 billion (Sh228 billion) in multiplier benefits.The study, which was commissioned by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in 2001, applied Tiomin's findings in its analysis.An earth scientist, Dr Carey Francis Onyango says that the ore is worth at least Sh200 billion.Some opinion leaders think the venture is a veritable environment disaster in the making while its economic benefits to Kenya are not so clear.However, Kenya is expected to gain in taxes, new job opportunities and royalties.Tiomin Resources Inc, a Toronto-based mining company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is expecting to strip-mine for titanium starting in 2008.Scientists from Kenyatta University, in conjunction with non-governmental organisation ActionAid Kenya, produced an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) that raised a number of concerns that a study done for Tiomin itself seemed to have ignored.The land around Kwale is to be strip-mined, exposing mineral deposits up to 30 metres in depth. It is argued that damage will be caused by timbering, construction of roads, a mill, a power-generating plant, power-lines, and waste piles.Hundreds of agricultural families will be displaced and plants, trees, soil, houses, schools, and markets will be destroyed.The mineral deposits are associated with radioactive elements that could harm human health and the environment once exposed to the air.Kenyan scientists are concerned about sulphur dioxide emissions from the combustion of diesel fuels in the mining plants.There is concern over the pressure that the mining will exert on water resources in the area.In a past report, a Tiomin Kenya representative had categorically ruled out engaging in any upgrading of the titanium ores beyond cleaning them for export. To the company, putting up the (smelting and roasting) plants would be uneconomical when the quantity of titanium in Kwale was too small to allow for the realisation of costs. ' 'The controversial titanium mining project in Kwale [Coast Province] has been hit by a new wave of confusion after a Chinese company opted out of an agreement to take control of the project from a Canadian company.Jinchuan Group of China announced it was terminating an agreement to acquire 70 per cent of the project from Canada's Tiomin Resources, just a day before the deal was to be closed.Jinchuan said it was 'not satisfied with the disclosure schedule' presented by Tiomin as it opted out of the deal only two months after agreeing to acquire a controlling stake in Tiomin Kenya Ltd (TKL) and invest 1.8bn [24.9m US dollars] to develop the project.Ironically, the decision came only a day after Tiomin obtained authority from the Kenya government, something that was the last condition before closing of the deal.'We find this decision astonishing, given that the Government of Kenya finally delivered on its material commitments to getting this deal done,' said Tiomin chief executive Robert Jackson in a statement.He accused Jinchuan of using Tiomin to negotiate for supply contracts elsewhere, and said the company would proceed with a shareholders meeting to approve the transaction, regardless of the development.Just two months ago, the companies signed an investment agreement that would have seen Jinchuan assume control of the project, dogged by twists and turns since Tiomin discovered huge deposits of titanium in Kwale.The Chinese company, which is the biggest nickel producer, had committed to finance, develop and operate the venture that has failed to kick off due to controversies and Tiomin's lack of capacity.Soil relationshipConsummation of the deal would have seen Tiomin retain a 30 per cent stake, and cease to inject any further capital to the project. The net cash flow generated would initially have been used to repay project debt, and thereafter net free cash flow was to be re-distributed pro-rata, 70 per cent to Jinchuan and 30 per cent to Tiomin.The decision by Jinchuan to pull out of the agreement now throws the project into a spin and fuels fears that the project will never take off.It could also end a relationship between the two companies, which has existed since 2005, when Jinchuan first got involved with the project after it bought 20 per cent of the mining rights at a cost of 750m shillings [10.4m US dollars].The Kwale project is estimated to hold 14 per cent of the world's titanium deposits, amounting to 3.2 billion tones, which can be extracted in a span of 20 years.'","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Kenya","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020050817e18h0025u&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"866","China","Low Interest Loan for Economic Houses (Duplicate)","2003","false","BDU English Copyright 2003 China Daily Information Company. All rights reserved. China and Angola, despite the long distance between the two countries, have been enjoying good relations especially in the field of economy and trade. The economic cooperation between the Asian and African nations could date back to 1983 when the bilateral diplomatic relationship was established. However, due to the 27-year civil war in Angola, the economic ties have not been fully developed although there were some Chinese companies doing business in Angola before the end of the war in April last year. Since early 1990s, the trade between the two countries began to develop gradually. In 2000, the trade volume reached US$1.876 billion compared with US$150 million in 1995. According to some estimation, the trade volume could stand at US$2 billion this year as the first nine months have seen it reaching US$1.7 billion. In order to accelerate the reconstruction of country after the civil war, the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has put forward an 'economic diplomacy' policy to attract foreign investment and technology and further develop trade with other countries. Two projects funded by the Chinese government on rebuilding the telecommunication network in three Angolan provinces and repairing some parts of Angolan railways have been carried out in October and November this year respectively. Besides, the Chinese government also provided Angola with economic aid in terms of grants and interest-free loans to the African country to help the displaced. The 15,000-sq. meter economic houses in Luanda, capital of Angola, built by a Chinese company with US$11 million of interest-free loan from the Chinese government have been deeply welcomed by the Angolan people. After seeing what the Chinese government companies have done in Angola, President dos Santos more than once expressed his hope that more Chinese businessmen would come to Angola to invest, trade and participate in the reconstruction of the country. Angola, a country with rich natural resources such as oil and diamond, needs assistance from other countries including China for rebuilding, dos Santos said. As the trade between China and Angola is complementary, the bilateral economic cooperation will surely come to a new high in the process of reconstructing Angola.

"1069","China","Kenya to sign oil search deal with China's CNOOC","2006","false","'NAIROBI, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Kenya said on Thursday it will sign an agreement with China's CNOOC Ltd next month to prospect for oil and gas in six blocks in the north and south of the country.'We hope by mid next month we will be signing a production sharing contract for six blocks with CNOOC of China,' Patrick Nyoike, the permanent secretary in the energy ministry, told Reuters. He said negotiations for the agreement, which began last month, ended positively on Wednesday.Nyoike said the talks with CNOOC Ltd was part of the government's strategy to turn to the Far East for investment. The entry of CNOOC, China's top offshore oil producer, will be the latest of a growing list of foreign firms tapping Kenya's market.Already active is Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd. which hopes to drill Kenya's first offshore deepwater well in L-5 block by the second quarter of next year.'They wanted to do it this year but they couldn't get a drilling ship. It has become very difficult to get a ship because of high (oil) prices,' Nyoike told Reuters.He said of the six blocks CNOOC Ltd is considering, one of the offshore blocks, block L-4, near Lamu, had potential gas reserves.'In the 1980s, a well was sunk, about 4,000 meters below ground and they came across gas, in those days nobody was interested in gas,' Nyoike said.'In block 9 which is onshore, the chances are promising geologically, but we don't know what is underground,' Nyoike said, adding that block 9 is also very close to Lamu.He had earlier addressed a meeting of experts preparing the privatisation of state-owned Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen).Nyoike said that power generation through natural gas turbines was the answer to lowering the cost of electricity in Kenya which local businesses say are 4 to 5 times higher than competitors in Egypt and South Africa pay.Kenya depends on hydropower dams for about 70 percent of its power supply. But the government has said it plans to diversify its sources of energy because of the unpredictability of weather.Kenya is a net importer of oil which accounted for 22.5 percent of total imports in the year to June 2005, according to central bank statistics.' 'Chinese giant and Kenyans look to form joint ventureChina National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is negotiating with the Kenyan government to establish a joint-enture company to explore the Anza basin on the Sudan border.CNOOC is currently studying data following discussions with Nairobi's Ministry of Energy. Two weeks ago, it completed initial talks with the National Oil Company of Kenya (Nock).The Chinese strategy evidently does not fit neatly into Kenya's exploration and production procedure and it is taking time to finalise the proposed special arrangement.However, it is understood joint-enture operations on open acreage may be permitted under a non-exclusive exploration regime agreed between the parties.At stake is primarily the Anza basin, located in the Tertiary rift section where prolific plays have been identified in the Muglad basin farther north in Sudan.Previous exploration there focused on the Lotikipi permit at Elia Springs in the Lochikar sub-basin where the last well was sunk by Shell back in 1993.Nairobi's geologists believe the Kenyan extension of the Muglad basin is underlain by Cretaceous strata and that could spell prospectivity on a par with southern Sudan.Meanwhile, Nairobi's Ministry of Energy has finalised the reduction by half of all its open offshore and onshore blocks, and plans to gazette the new licensing cartography by the end of this month.An Inter-Ministerial Petroleum Advisory Committee (IPAC), chaired by Nock managing director Mary M'Mukindia and stewarded by the Energy Ministry's permanent secretary Patrick Nyoike, is steering the review process in which both the Energy and Finance ministries participate along with the Attorney General's Office and the National Environmental Management Authority.Ministry officials revealed a new licensing round will kick off before the end of this year offering all the new open plays such as Lamu basin blocks L-4 and L-12, some of Kenya's deepest blocks reaching out to the 3000-metre isobar.Also revealed last week was an intention to announce 'ery soon' a comprehensive review of profit oil splits and cost recovery terms before the next licensing round.IPAC has already determined for this fiscal purpose that new depth ranges should stretch from the shallow waters, defined up to 500 metres, then running into the deeper waters until the 1000-metre isobar with incentives for the ultra deep defined beyond that.IPAC has reviewed the existing Petroleum Act and despatched the new code to the Attorney General's Office, which will shortly submit the new Bill to parliament.Kenya's attractive 'no royalties' provision will be retained under the new regime and the government will continue to pay corporation tax on the explorer's behalf out of the company's allocated oil profits.' 'Only late last month, the Kenya government and the visiting Chinese delegation led by Premier Hu Jintao signed an agreement to grant China Offshore Corporation, a Chinese company, the rights to prospect for oil in the country.This presents a major challenge for Kenya, to get the capacity building done in good time. The country needs an enabling legal framework, community goodwill and supporting infrastructure.The existing law, the Mining Act (Cap 306), which commenced application in October 1940, does not reflect the liberal philosophy developed after studying the experiences of the mining nations of Africa after the 1980s. It may need a total review to rid it from the philosophy of state control that prevailed in the 1940s.Specifically, we need to stretch the land-use band to accommodate the increasing mining interests in Kenya.POLICY PLANNERS across a number of sectors need to focus on reforming the current framework governing land use and tenure, the environment, trade, security, infrastructure and services, taxation, importation of skilled labour, repatriation of profits and issues of equitable distribution of benefits between central and local governments.Luckily for Kenya, it can learn from the experiences of the mining industry in other African countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, experiences that have redefined the role of the state.In the 1960s and 1970s, the state had significant, if not full ownership of shares in mining companies in an effort to ensure that earnings from these national assets benefited the nation as a whole. Unfortunately, by the late 1980s, much of the mining industry in Africa was under-performing.This led to a fundamental shift in policy and attitudes, with state ownership declining from 100 per cent to almost complete withdrawal. The previous state enterprises were privatised and nations adopted strategies and legislation favourable to private investors.This is the prospecting climate that attracted Tiomin Inc of Canada, which is mining titanium in Kwale in Kenya's Coast province, as well as a number of other private investors who have shown interest in prospecting for oil along the Coast and the arid and semi-arid north.The Tiomin experience in Kwale should forewarn us of the difficulties ahead in securing land under individual ownership for the purposes of mining. In the case of Tiomin, displaced local communities were to be given alternative land and compensated. But the compensation figures arrived at after the valuation of the land became contentious. Environmental concerns had to be addressed and the necessary impact assessments undertaken.Government licenses had to be issued by the respective ministries. The scenario was optimal for populist local politics. The totality of all these and other requirements and associated protocol resulted in such major delays that the investor had to repeatedly postponed the commencement of the project. This is not healthy for such investments.IT WOULD help if we understood the immense benefits that we stand to reap from a robust mining industry. Our economy can certainly do with the improved revenues, foreign exchange earnings, direct and indirect employment and the transfer and development of technical skills.Host local communities will gain from improved property value employment, support in the development of schools, dams and hospitals and access to physical infrastructure supporting mining activity such as roads, communications, water and power. Mining areas also support the sprouting of urban centres that bring commerce and attract other services.The government must nonetheless take measures to cushion local communities from adverse environmental impacts such as water and atmospheric pollution as well as the adverse social impacts associated with the adulteration of local culture. The sudden increase in population also exerts pressure on the existing infrastructure which may require higher maintenance or rehabilitation.Kenya also needs to learn the lessons of the mining states of Africa in regard to conflicts associated with mineral resources. Nigeria, Liberia and Congo offer good case studies.We must do all we can to promote a climate where our expected mineral wealth will be a boon to our economy and national cohesion, not a source of territorial conflicts.Northern Kenya, for example, has remained underdeveloped for far too long. One hopes that the oil prospecting being done in this region will eventually bear fruits that will be directed towards its development and help bring it into the 21 century.The development of northern Kenya will certainly promote trade with Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan. Trade and access to trading centres and schools will offer a major boost to our policing efforts in the area. Let any proceeds from oil be dedicated to this broad national cause.BUT ABOVE all, what is needed is good planning and political commitment.It is not in doubt is that there are positive prospects for minerals and mineral oil in Kenya. A major world economy like China does not casually sign agreements for oil prospecting. It is time to mobilise and provide an enabling business environment, a favourable legal framework, prepare forecasts for electricity and other infrastructure needs and prepare our national and local leaders to 'think Kenya' in the event of mineral wealth discoveries our country.Ibrahim N. Mwathane is a consulting surveyor in private practice and a member of the Physical Infrastructure Board of the Kenya Private Sector Alliance.' 'China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) has returned four out of six exploration blocks in Kenya to the government, according to local press reports. The Chinese state major will only retain onshore Blocks L-2 and 9, according to a report in the Daily Nation newspaper.Quoting the permanent secretary for energy, Patrick Nyoike, the newspaper said CNOOC would return Blocks L-4, 1, 10A and L-3. The official was quoted as saying that the blocks would be awarded soon to other companies and that Kenya had received expressions of interest in exploration back in March from South Korea's SK Corp. -- recently renamed SK Energy -- and CPC of Taiwan.Earlier this year Australia's Woodside Petroleum shelved a planned second offshore exploration well just a few days after revealing that Pomboo-1, its first well in the offshore Lamu Basin, had been unsuccessful. The Pomboo wildcat was the first exploration well in the country for over 20 years (IOD Jan.26,p7). Woodside has a 30% stake in the two blocks together with Spain's Repsol YPF (20%), Global Petroleum (20%) and UK independent Dana Petroleum (30%).

"1132","China","Resettlement of refugees (Duplicate)","2008","false","'Kenya's coalition cabinet met Thursday for the first time since it was formed a month ago and vowed to address problems left behind by recent nationwide violence. The creation of the 42-member cabinet was key to ending nationwide unrest after President Mwai Kibaki was accused of stealing victory in December polls. A power-sharing arrangement saw opposition chief Raila Odinga appointed as prime minister. The cabinet, in its first collective decision, made food security and restoring security its top priority. 'We must have the drive to succeed in serving our country and Kenyans at large, there is much expectation from the Kenyan people and we must deliver on the promises we made,' Kibaki sad. The cabinet is the largest and mostly costly since the country gained independence from Britain in 1963.The cabinet formed five committees, namely: national security; finance, administration and planning; infrastructure; as well as services and production to help boost stability and growth in the east Africa's most vibrant economy.Kenya is threatened by an acute food shortages which follow months of post-election violence that killed 1,500 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. The cabinet agreed to urgently increase its strategic maize reserves increased from the current four million bags to eight million bags over the next two years. The state-run National Cereals and Produce Board was ordered to three million bags of maize in the next few weeks as a precautionary measure while the government seeks measures of improving agriculture. In addition to shattering Kenya's reputation as a bastion of stability in a region beset by conflicts, the political crisis choked the mainstay tourism and agricultural sectors. The treasury slashed the 2008 growth forecast from 7.0 percent to between 4.5 and 6.0 percent, with independent economists putting it at an average of four percent. The April inflation rate stood at 26.7 percent owing to soaring food and fuel costs. Meanwhile, the Chinese government gave Kenya 200 million shillings (3.2 million dollars) to help resettle hundreds of thousands of villagers who were uprooted from their villages by the political turmoil. This dwarfed a government appeal for 30 billion shillings (492 million dollars, 319 million euros) made by the government. In addition, China gave Kenya an interest-free loan of 500 million shillings (eight million dollars). 'This demonstrates the value your government attaches to the enduring friendship and genuine relations between our two countries and peoples, based on mutual respect,' Kibaki said in a statement. 'Our prayers go to the families of those who lost their lives and those who have suffered injuries or lost their properties and means of livelihood.' The government said 70 percent of about 300,000 displaced people have been settled in or close to their homes.'//中国驻肯尼亚大使馆15日代表中国政府向肯尼亚政府提供总额2000万元人民币的援助，以帮助肯尼亚安置因选举骚乱而无家可归的民众以及重建国家。　　肯尼亚总统姆瓦伊·齐贝吉对中国提供的援助表示感谢。他说，这一善举表明中国十分重视中肯两国政府和人民之间友好、真诚的合作关系。　　齐贝吉说，尤其令他感动的是，中国在自身遭遇特大地震灾害、造成大量人员伤亡的情况下，仍然向肯尼亚伸出援手。他再次代表肯尼亚政府和人民向在四川省汶川县地震中遇难的中国人表示哀悼，向遇难者家属和中国人民表示慰问。　　肯尼亚去年12月底举行大选，选举委员会宣布总统齐贝吉成功连任，但主要反对党“橙色民主运动”指责其舞弊，拒绝接受选举结果。随后，肯尼亚各地爆发大规模骚乱，造成上千人死亡，30多万人无家可归。今年2月底，在安南的调停下，肯政府与“橙色民主运动”签署分权协议。4月，联合政府正式成立。(Note: If you add the grant and loan amounts mentioned in the Factiva articles of Project ID: 1132 an 1133, and convert the amount to CNY, it comes to be close to the 20,000,000 CNY total assistance amount mentioned in the Chinese article.

"1207","China","China to Finance Dam-duplicate with 1164","2009","false","The China Eximbank has agreed to finance construction of the 1,350 MW Mepanda Nkuwa dam on the Zambezi river some 60 km downstream from the Cahora Bassa dam. The project’s cost has been estimated at USD 2 billion.Beijing will also lend around USD 300 million to Mozambique to build a transmission line between the future dam and Maputo. Most of the energy produced by the new facility will be exported to the rest of southern Africa, and particularly South Africa. The funding contracts still remain to be finalized. For that to happen, negotiations between the China Eximbank, Electricidade de Mocambique (EDM) and other would-be customers of the dam that the energy ministry hasn’t identified need to be completed in June.Energy minister Salvador Namburete hopes that all the agreements will be concluded by the end of the year to allow actual construction to begin next April or May after the cyclone season. Mozambique is gambling that the dam will attract industries that require a lot of energy. China’s decision came despite strong protests from defenders of the environment belonging to the NGO Justica Ambiental who travelled to Shanghai in 2007 in the hope of dissuading Chinese promoters of the scheme from proceeding with it. At the time, the ecologists voiced doubts over the physical soundness of the future dam in a region subject to major earth tremors. An initial draft of the scheme was produced by Brazil’s Camargo Correia and its Mozambican partner, Insitec.There is also question of China’s Eximbank financing the construction of the Moamba Major dam on the Nkomati river some 80 km south of Maputo, whose cost has been assessed at USD 300 million, so as to supply water to the capital.62942524|XMLExtract_AEM_605.xmlDocument AEIN000020090613e55r0000o","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Mozambique","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AEIN000020090613e55r0000o&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"1214","China","Further Chinese Funds for National Stadium Inactive","2009","false","Further Chinese Funds for National Stadium800 words3 March 200903:37 PMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2009 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedMaputo, Mar 03, 2009 (Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Chinese government has pledged a further 2.5 million US dollars to finance work to remove soil from the site where the new Mozambican national stadium is being built.The schedule remains unchanged, that is, that the stadium will be complete before the football World Cup to be held in South Africa, in 2010.To this end, Mozambique and China signed a memorandum of understanding in Maputo on Monday, according to which the money, that had not been initially budgeted, but was shown to be necessary because of the nature of the soil, is to be disbursed in time to complete the work on schedule.The document was signed between Mozambique's Minister of Tourism, Youth and Sports, Fernando Sumbana, and the Chinese Ambassador Tiang Guang Feng.This means that the national stadium, the biggest and most modern sports infrastructure in the country, with a capacity for 42,000 seats, will now cost 60 million US dollars.Paying a visit to the site, in the outer Maputo suburb of Zimpeto, for the first time as Youth and Sports Minister, Sumbana expressed satisfaction with the progress of the work, and with the transfer of know how by the Chinese technical staff.'Here, at the national stadium, we had the opportunity to see that the work is progressing at a satisfactory pace, with the involvement of the knowledge that our Chinese partners are dispensing and also the involvement of the Mozambican multi-sector team, that is fully dedicated to this work', said Sumbana.The technical team on the site said that the construction of the foundations will be completed before the end of this month, and that, of the 850 planned pillars, only 100 are still to be installed.Speaking of his other visits to sports facilities, Sumbana said that the stadium in Pemba, capital of the northern province of Cabo Delgado, is also making good progress, and should be ready for use by 2010As for the 'Mario Esteves Coluna' stadium, in the town of Namaacha, on the border with Swaziland, Sumbana said that only a few details are left to turn it into a true training ground for new Mozambican athletes.Le/bm/pf (372) 10309 GUEBUZA CONDEMNS ASSASSINATION OF GUINEA-BISSAU PRESIDENTMaputo, 3 Mar (AIM) - Mozambican President Armando Guebuza said on Monday that it is 'incomprehensible' that today there are still people who want to change the political order by using illegal and unconstitutional means.He was reacting to the assassination earlier in the day of the President of Guinea-Bissau, Joao Bernardo 'Nino' Vieira, killed at his home by a group of soldiers, in apparent retaliation for the bomb blast that took the life of the Chief of Staff of the armed forces, Gen Tagme Na Waie.Guebuza told reporters that he found both murders repugnant, and completely unacceptable.He called for calm in Guinea-Bissau, and guaranteed that Mozambique, along with the other members of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP), is following developments there closely.Former President Joaquim Chissano, interviewed by the independent daily 'O Pais', said that he had learnt with deep sorrow of the deaths of Tagme Na Waie and Nino Vieira.'This is very sad for the Guinean people', he said. 'We are in an epoch where conflicts should be solved through dialogue. Guinea-Bissau is a backward country that needs international support so that it can get back onto its feet, and this support will only be possible with stability'.Chissano knows Guinea-Bissau well. He was special envoy to the country of then UN General Secretary Kofi Annan in the run-up to the elections of 2005 which returned Vieira (who had been deposed in a 1998 coup) to power. He recalled that in that period he had worked with both Tagme Na Waie and Vieira to re-establish peace.Chissano said that Tagme Na Waie 'played a fundamental role in the pacification of the country, and in Nino Vieira's return from exile, since he appealed to the armed forces to abstain from politics. It is sad that they have had such a tragic end'.Nonetheless, Chissano did not believe that the murders mean that Guinea-Bissau can be written off as a failed state. 'Work is needed, in this moment of instability, so that Guinea-Bissau becomes viable', he said. 'But we should remember that the country has been stable for the past four and a half years. Now it's up to the people of Guinea-Bissau, to ECOWAS, and to the CPLP to work to restore stability. The prime responsibility lies with the Guinean people. You can't just throw a country away'.

"1200","Gabon","eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee","2009","true","UPDATE 1-INTERVIEW-World Bank upbeat on Mozambique's economyBy Charles Mangwiro572 words25 April 200803:05 AMReuters NewsLBAEnglish(c) 2008 Reuters LimitedMAPUTO, April 25 (Reuters) - Mozambique's target of eight percent economic growth this year is realistic despite floods and cyclones which hit the country this year, a World Bank official said.The World Bank's Mozambique director Michael Baxter also said inflation, which stood at 8.4 percent in 2007, could be kept in single digits in 2008.'We believe, and everybody else agrees, the 8 percent growth rate is realistic and achievable despite all the traditional shocks of natural calamities,' he told Reuters in an interview conducted on Thursday.The World Bank is the largest donor to Mozambique, where the economy grew 7.5 percent in 2007. Its role has focused on budget support and reconstruction projects.Huge interest from foreign companies in the country's natural and mineral wealth has put pressure on the government to develop infrastructure and power sources, which could boost regional trade.Growth is largely driven by foreign aid, while the local economy has been slow to develop, especially small- and medium-sized firms that struggle to secure financing.Mozambique was one of the world's poorest nations at the end of a 17-year civil war in 1992, but has had one of the fastest growing economies in southern Africa over the past decade.The former Portuguese colony's government has embarked on reforms to stabilise the economy, which, coupled with Western donor aid and political stability, have boosted economic growth.But most of the country's population of 20 million live in poverty, and depend heavily on subsistence agriculture.RESTRAINING EXPENDITUREBaxter said investment would boost the economy, but fiscal discipline and prudent financial management were essential.'It is possible because the strong growth continues in the large projects and construction while investments are increasing tourism,' said Baxter, who also oversees World Bank operations in Angola, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.'Although the challenge is to restrain expenditure and manage the budget.'Mozambique is hungry for foreign investment.The government is eager to upgrade the Cahora Bassa hydro-electric plant, which was built under Portuguese colonial rule in 1960 and then badly neglected during a civil war after independence in 1975.Cahora Bassa has the potential to generate 14,000 megawatts of power, about seven times current capacity, according to the government in Maputo. But getting it to that level will require major investment.China became the sixth largest foreign investor in Mozambique last year while the United States topped the list with $5 billion worth of investment, officials say.Mozambique's Investment Promotion centre (CPI) said China invested $60 million in 11 projects in agriculture, aquaculture, public works and forestry.Turning to the election crisis in Zimbabwe, Baxter said the bank planned to help after results of the disputed March 29 poll were announced.'We are more than ready to assist when those conditions are in place on a larger scale although there is some backlog of issues to clear up,' he said.'For example, how are we going to assure the payment of arrears and guarantees of future payments.'Zimbabweans are suffering from chronic food, fuel and foreign currency shortages, high unemployment and the world's highest inflation rate of 165,000 percent.

"1254","China","Financing for northern rail extension project","1997","false",">Namibia's network of over 5,000 km of tarred and 27,000 km of gravel roads is generally well maintained, and its rail, harbour and air services are efficiently operated. The economy is therefore largely free from transport bottlenecks. Two agencies hived off from the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications are responsible for construction and maintenance of the highway network. Road links to Namibia's eastern neighbours have been improved by the construction, mainly funded by donors, of the trans-Kalahari and trans-Caprivi highways. The trans-Kalahari highway, completed in 1998, has greatly reduced the road distance between South Africa's Gauteng region and Walvis Bay, but use of the route has been below expectations owing to logistical problems. The trans-Caprivi road from Rundu to the Botswanan border at Ngoma was completed in 2001, and the construction of a permanent bridge across the Zambezi River to Zambia at Kazungula, due for completion in 2004, will improve the route for trucks, which are presently ferried across. Two shipping lines provide weekly and biweekly direct connections between Walvis Bay and Europe. A regional service sails between Maputo in Mozambique and Luanda in Angola>> >>The TransNamib multimodal transport parastatal, established before independence, was restructured in 1997 into autonomous subsidiaries covering the railways, the country's largest road-haulage fleet, and the national airline, Air Namibia. However, the parastatal has become unprofitable owing to growing competition from private road hauliers, and poor mismanagement, which has led to the need for increasing government subsidies. In 2001 the entire board was sacked and replaced by the members of a presidential commission of inquiry that had completed a critical report earlier that year. The 2,400-km metre-gauge railway network once carried more than 1m tonnes of freight a year. Recent figures have not been published, but traffic is likely to have declined owing to the improved road network. Efforts to revie passenger traffic by upgrading the service have had some success, and in 1998 a Luxury Desert Express between Windhoek and Swakopmund for tourists was launched. In 2001 work began on the northern rail extension project, the first new line for more than 50 years, which aims to improve economic links for Namibia's most populated region. The 260-km line to link Tsumeb to Ondangwa, Oshakati, and Oshikango on the Angolan border will cost N$580m over four years. It is being part-financed by concessional loans from China and Kuwait. >","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Implementation","2","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=eiucp00020030801dz7v0003a&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"1328","China","China Begins Prospecting [not a project]","2006","true","China's foreign minister embarked yesterday on his first tour of a year in which he will rack up tens of thousands of air miles in pursuit of increasingly scarce natural resources to fuel the world's fastest growing large economy. Oer the next 10 days, Li Zhaoxing will regale leaders of six African nations with his wit and even perhaps his poetry as he seeks to consolidate relations on a continent where China's interests have become crucial to its economic might. Beijing has also quietly revied the notion of Third-World solidarity that dictated its support in the 1960s and 1970s for newly independent states and liberation movements across the continent. But rather than competing for influence against old Cold War foes, China is now competing with western businessmen for supply contracts, mineral sources and energy ventures to feed the voracious appetite of an economy growing at 10 per cent a year. Only last week, China's top offshore oil producer, CNOOC, agreed to pay $2.3 billion U.S. for a stake in a Nigerian oil and gas field -- its largest overseas acquisition. In Nigeria, Mr. Li will sign a memorandum of understanding on further economic co-operation. He will also visit Cape Verde, Senegal, Mali, Liberia and Libya. Western rivals accuse China of doing deals with some thoroughly unsavoury regimes in its quest for natural resources. Chinese officials counter that Beijing's long-held policy is not to interfere in the affairs of others. It is a policy that has allowed China go to places such as Sudan, Myanmar and North Korea that are off-limits to many western powers. Beijing notably rolled out the red carpet for President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe last year. Kong Quan, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said: 'China has always been opposed to some countries, people and organizations labelling other countries in this or that way.' China now obtains about 28 per cent of its oil imports from Africa -- mainly Angola, Sudan and Congo. Chinese companies have snapped up offshore blocks in Angola, built pipelines in Sudan and have begun prospecting in Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad. Chinese interests are not limited to energy. One of the biggest Chinese mining operations on the continent is the Chambishi copper mine in Zambia. In South Africa, China-controlled ASA Metals Ltd. said last week that it wanted to triple output of ferrochrome -- an alloy used in stainless steel to deter corrosion -- by 2008. And Chinese investors are seeking nickel deposits in such fragile nations as Burundi. Chinese-funded enterprises in Africa increased by 77 in 2004 to 715. The new companies invested $135 million with plans for investment of $432 million, a Chinese official said. Trade has soared. Two-way trade leapt 39 per cent in the first 10 months of last year. Exports totalled $15.2 billion, while imports reached $16.9 billion. Between 2002 and 2003, trade soared by 50 per cent to $18.5 billion -- the fastest growth China has seen with any region. Some African businessmen complain that China is flooding the continent with cheap goods and putting domestic manufacturers out of business. To counter such criticisms, China ensures that its investments are accompanied by medical and other humanitarian aid, scholarships and generous construction projects. Third-World Solidarity. Tripling the Gap: China's trade surplus soars, page D1Colour Photo: Reuters / The Palace of Culture in the Iory Coast capital of Abidjan was built by the Chinese, who blazed a diplomatic trail across Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, offering support to newly independent states and throwing their weight behind liberation movements and the fight against apartheid. Today, with its expanding economy ever more thirsty for oil and raw materials, Beijing is working to turn that history of diplomatic goodwill into concrete energy and investment deals.

Yang said China would continue to work together with the United Nations, the African Union (AU) and African countries concerned to play a constructive role in solving the above issues at an early date and promoting lasting peace, stability and development of African countries concerned and African continent as a whole. Yang and Seyoum signed an agreement on economic and technological cooperation following the talks. They also answered questions from media.

"1363","China","Tractors (Duplicate of 1444)","2001","false","10 October 2001From 2000 to this year, Tanzania has received 230 tractors from various donors, namely Japan, Korea and China. Thirty tractors arrived last year, and 200 were shipped in early this year. Out of these, the government of Japan, 25 by the Korean government has donated 170 tractors and the Chinese have up to this year donated 15 tractors.However, only 24 tractors, slightly less than 10 percent of those imported, have actually been sold to farmers, most of whom think the prices being charged by the Ministry of Agriculture are exorbitant. The Ministry has, however, refused to reveal the actual prices of the various models of tractors received from the three donor nations.It only said that the government had incurred a total cost of Tshs87, 773,000 being transport charges, port fees, unloading, and demonstrations-related costs.However, an assessment by this agency has established that the Ministry was selling a tractor at up to Tshs15, 000,000. Clients complain that this price is too high, and possibly even higher than the price of a similar tractor being sold by a trader dealing in agricultural equipment.The tractors Sold at Tshs15, 000,000, are heavy-duty tractors, which are reported to be very popular with farmers, especially in the southern highlands of Tanzania. This paper also established that the price for the Chines tractors was around Tshs2, 548,000. These tractors are, however, light duty tractors, and many potential purchasers believe they are not powerful enough for their needs.Both individual farmers, and representatives of community-based organizations, have been coming to Dar Es Salaam to check out the tractors contributed by donors, but complain that the prices are prohibitive.They told this paper in Dar Es Salaam that, the price did not reflect the fact that this equipment was provided on a donor basis, and that most farmers would not be able to afford them.On the Korean tractors, The ministry said that the Korean tractors were specifically for the Modern Farm Project in Morogoro Region eastern Tanzania and they had already been sold to the stakeholders in this project.When this paper wanted to know the actual allocation of the 24 tractors sold so far, the ministry said these are the Japanese models and have been sold to buyers in eight regions. According to the ministry, no Chinese tractors have yet been sold, as they are still being assembled.The ministry further said that training and demonstrations have been held in 12 regions at a cost of Tshs21, 000,000. As to why the ministry was selling tractors at an exorbitant price, the ministry said the problem was not the high prices, but the low purchasing power of the farmers.'Farmers are not capable of purchasing the tractors. They do not have enough money to buy them on a cash basis,' the ministry said in its response.Asked whether donors had issued any conditions as to how the tractors should be sold, the ministry said that for the Japanese tractors, Tanzania has been directed to sell them at a price equivalent to two thirds of the total acquisition cost of the tractors. It did not, however, specify the exact purchasing price of these Japanese tractors.On the tractors from China and Korea, it said the agreed rate comprises import price, port charges, transport and loading and unloading-related costs. As to allocation, the ministry said it was according to the demand and orders from the respective regions.The ministry also said that the money from the tractor sales would be put into a special fund to finance agricultural-related training and demonstrations, sponsorship of farming projects and social service programs. It did not elaborate.Despite that agriculture accounts for about half of the national income, is the main source of the country's food, and employs about 80 percent of the population, Tanzania has not yet produced polices designed to develop, and modernize the sector.The sectors is still dominated by small-holder farmers cultivating, on average, farms ranging in size from 0.9 to 3.0 hectares each.About 70 percent of Tanzania's crop area is cultivated by hoe, 20 percent by ox plough, and 10 percent by tractor. It is all rainfed agriculture, and no major irrigation schemes are in operation.Labor and land productivity is currently falling due to poor technology, and dependence on unreliable and irregular weather conditions. Considering that the overall GDP growth target for halving abject poverty by 2010 is in the range of 6-7 percent, experts say that this performance falls short of the needed growth as the agricultural sector is growing too slowly.Tanzania is well endowed with a variety of farming systems with climatic variations and agro-ecological conditions permitting the cultivation of an extremely large variety of crops.by Tomric CorrespondentCopyright TOMRIC News Agency.

It will reduce the transportation time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project, an estimated total cost of $612 million, will be financed by a $350 million Export-Import Bank of China loan, and the Ethiopian government covering the balance.Construction began in April 2010. According to Samson Wondimu, Communication Director of ERA, construction was more than 30% complete in April 2012. This project has provided the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. It is also expected to contribute to the development of roadways between capital and regional locations, such as Hawassa and Bale. Construction is expected to be completed in early 2014. Terms of the loan are uncertain.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","210","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Ethiopia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020090628e56s000ru&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"1472","China","Afife Irrigation project [commitment year too early]","1962","false","In 2002 Jun 19, 2002 (Ghanaian Chronicle/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) - THE CHINESE government has donated an amount of $8million (about o56million) to the Dangbe East constituency to build a hospital. They are also going to help in the construction of some portions of the Accra-Kumasi road.This was disclosed in Accra when China's vice Minister for Foreign Affairs in charge of Africa, H.E Yang Wenchang, held bilateral talks with Ghana's deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Alhaji Mustapha Ali Idris.Hon. Ali Idris expressed satisfaction on the excellent bilateral relations between Ghana and China which was established four decades ago and which has been characterised in recent times by the visits of the vice president, Mr Jinn Jintao, in January 1999.He stated that the minister's visit is an illustration of the continued desire of both countries to strengthen their bonds of friendship.He expressed Ghana's appreciation for China's continued financial and technical assistance in the health, agriculture, education and, more recently, the construction sectors.The Afife Irrigation project, the National Theatre in Accra, construction of new housing units at police and military barracks and Dangbe East district hospital and vocational training school at Dansoman are all examples of Chinese projects from which Ghana has benefited.The deputy minister further expressed gratitude to the Chinese government on the cancellation of debts owed to China arising from loans given to Ghana from 1972 to 1998 and also the agreement in principle to provide financial support for the construction of 17.6 kilometre two-way lane and 40.5 kilometre dual carriage portions of the Accra-Kumasi road within three years.Explaining the NEPAD initiative to the vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, the minister said it is about Ghana's efforts to strengthen peace and security with good governance through NEPAD and efforts by the leaders of the sub-region to achieve a meaningful and sustainable development.He commended China for her contribution to Africa's development and hoped that the establishment of the Sino-Africa conference will offer more opportunities for Africa and China to continue to consult in the interest of concerted action aimed at addressing the wide range of issues of mutual concern and deepening the solidarity which is essential for addressing the common challenges presented by globalisation.The Chinese foreign minister on his part said Ghana is one of the sub-saharan countries to welcome China, with the leaders having a very profound relationship between them.He continued that despite the leadership changes, their relationship is still very cordial in the sense that their assistance to Ghana will not change because it is not directed to a particular government but to the people of Ghana.The foreign minister re-assured that the Chinese government is ready to work with the Kufuor administration since Ghana and China are all developing countries.He supported the NEPAD initiative and the preparedness of his government to join in its implementation. He hinted that a certain amount of money has been given to the Ghana government but the amount was however not known.by Linda AkrasiCopyright Ghanaian Chronicle.

"1655","China","China to Construct Hospital (duplicate with ID: 1673)","2007","false","Oct 01, 2007 (The Analyst/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Chinese government through her embassy near Monrovia is expected to construct a 150 bed-room hospital in the southeastern region. Speaking at the signing ceremony of Memorandum of Understanding between the both government at the Foreign Affairs Ministry on Friday, the new Chinese Ambassador to Liberia, Zhou Yuxiao said the hospital will be constructed in the south eastern region but added that the main area of the construction has not yet be identified. Ambassador Yuxiao further said the county of the construction will identify by the technical team that is expected in the shortly from China, adding that the there are some bench mark that will be used to determine the locality of the hospital but he was quick to say that the all will be done by then technical team and through the assistance of the Liberian government. Amb. Yuxiao maintained that the hospital is to provide assistance to the people of that region, noting after the 15 years of brutal civil unrest, every sector of the country is left ruined, including the health sector of the country. 'Liberia needs the assistance of every country in the world that had the financial power to help her get on her feet', he said. He said the construction will be done by a Liberian construction firm while the technical aspect will be carried out by the Chinese experts who will soon be in the country following the final approval of the budget by the Chinese government. 'This construction will is been done several African countries including Liberia.' According to him, China will not allow Liberia to carry her burden alone but expressed willingness to work along with the country to achieve her developmental goals. 'We are one people so we should be in the position to help in every way'. He said Liberia had help China in so many ways but especially at the United Nations, 'so we should in return be able to help in return', he told the ceremony. He stressed that what has been in Liberia by the Chinese government is not enough but is the sign of the good bilateral relations between the two countries. Responding, on behalf on Liberia, Acting Foreign Affairs Minister, William V. S. Bull thanked the Chinese envoy for his country's continuous support to Liberia. Mr. Bull said that one of the main objectives of the Unity Party led government is improving the health sector of the state; the gesture of the Chinese government is highly welcoming. He also stated that building of the hospital in the southeastern region will help reduce the health hazard in that part of the country. He maintained that the construction will also create jobs opportunity for many Liberians, noting that the decision by the envoy to give the construction of the hospital to a Liberian firm is a clear indication of patronizing the Liberalization policy. He however, said that the continuous support of Chinese government to Liberia will ever be remembered by the people of the state.

"1659","China","Building a Military Barracks (duplicate with ID: 1617)","2008","false","MONROVIA, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Too much Western aid can become an addictive drug for poor African countries and Chinese investment offers an alternative, mutually-beneficial relationship, China's ambassador to Liberia said on Wednesday. Zhou Yuxiao urged other countries to follow China's lead in cancelling debt to Liberia, a once-prosperous West African country struggling to recover from a 1989-2003 civil war. China cancelled its $12 million bilateral debt a year ago. China was also interested in investing in a tax-exempt economic zone being planned by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf's government to kick-start economic activity. 'Too much aid is not good for a country. It's like drugs ... If you are addicted to it, it becomes bad,' Yuxiao told Reuters in an interview. 'China is calling for win-win cooperation, or mutual beneficial cooperation.' China has pumped billions of dollars into Africa in recent years in search of natural resources for its booming economy. That has unnerved Western donors, who worry that it is ignoring human rights abuses. Since they opened relations in 1977, China has twice broken off diplomatic ties with Liberia -- when President Samuel Doe and his successor, warlord Charles Taylor, recognised Taiwan in return for generous aid and investment. In 2004, China deployed 500 peacekeepers to Liberia, its biggest-ever contribution to a U.N. peacekeeping mission, after an interim government reopened diplomatic ties in 2003, shortly after the end of the war which killed some 200,000 Liberians. DEBT RELIEF President Johnson-Sirleaf, who took office two years ago, has been keen to court China. Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Liberia a year ago and announced the cancellation of Liberia's bilateral debt. 'We are calling on other counties to cancel Liberia's debt. If the debt issue can not be resolved, it will affect Liberia's economic development,' Yuxiao said. Years of political strife, economic mismanagement and corruption have left Liberia with foreign debts of $4.5 billion, most of that to multi-lateral lending institutions. The World Bank said in December Liberia cleared its $400 million debt to the organisation, thanks largely to a loan from the United States. At present, China is helping Liberia build a $3 million military barracks in the centre of country and opening a Chinese teaching centre at the University of Liberia. As in many African countries, the football stadium in the Liberian capital Monrovia was Chinese-built. Liberia, Africa's oldest Republic, was founded by freed American slaves in 1847, and has long been a staunch ally of the United States. U.S. President George W. Bush is due to visit Liberia this month. Yuxiao, a 54-year-old diplomat who had previously worked in Nigeria and South Africa, said China was not hoping to step into America's shoes. 'There is no scramble for Liberia. As you know, Liberia has special relations with America and we have normal relations,' he said. 'We do not compete with America.'

This will then be connected to the SAT 3 in Accra for connectivity into the information world.This was revealed by the deputy minister of communications, Dr. Benjamin Aggrey Ntim, during the start of the tenth information and communication technology exhibition and conference in Accra organized by AITEC West Africa yesterday.He said to facilitate the judicious use of ICT in the country, the ministry of communications has facilitated the drafting of an e-Government Interoperability Framework Policy (e-GIF).'Areas such as interconnectivity, data integration, e-services access and content management will be covered, thus articulating a set of agreed policies and standards to allow electronic information and transactions to operate seamlessly across agencies and jurisdictions,' he added.Speaking on the topic 'e-Government and Knowledge Management', the Director of the Ghana Information and Communications Technology Directorate (GICTeD), the operational arm of the Ministry of Communications, said the e-government project has reached the stage where laws are being formulated to monitor the sector called e-legislation.E-government is a form of e-business in governance and refers to the processes and structures pertinent to the delivery of electronic services to the public (citizens and businesses), collaborating with business partners and conducting electronic transactions within an organizational entity.The Director, Mr. Kojo Anyane-Yeboa, said the strategic objective of e-governance is to support and simplify governance for all parties; government (G2G), citizens (G2C), and businesses (G2B). The use of ICTs can connect all three parties and support processes and activities.In other words, in e-governance electronic means to support and stimulate good governance, therefore the objectives of e-governance are similar to the objectives of good governance.Good governance can be seen as an exercise of economic, political, and administrative authority to better manage affairs of a country at all levels.A distinction can be made between the objectives for internally focused processes (operations) and objectives for externally focused services of an e-government environment. He said the external objective of e-government is to fulfill the public's needs and expectations satisfactory on the front-office side, by simplifying the interaction with various online services. The use of ICT in government operations facilitates speedy, transparent, accountable, efficient and effective interaction with the public, citizens, business and other agencies.He said the internal objective of e-government in government operations is to facilitate a speedy, transparent, accountable, efficient and effective process for performing government administration activities.Significant cost savings (per transaction) in government operations can be the result.Ghana has embarked on an e-government journey that is expected to go on endlessly. Initiatives currently being undertaken by the Ministry of Communications include the creation of: an interoperability framework, e-legislation, community information centres, a national fibre optic backbone, a government network, a government portal, and a data centre.He said Ghana expects a 25% tele-density rate by 2010 from 15% in 2005.Document AFNWS00020060517e25h000sk ","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Fireoptic cable for telecommunications","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Ghana","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020060517e25h000sk&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

China also built the Friendship Textile Mills (Urafiki Textile Mills) which produces fabrics for local consumption as well as export. The only colliery in the country, the Kiwira Coal Mine - now partly privatised - was also borne of this friendship. Later the coal mine started producing electricity, which was connected to the national grid.Electricity from the mine has also benefited the neighbouring districts of Malawi.Document AFNWS00020070606e3660002u","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Export credits","Unset","","Tanzania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020070606e3660002u&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved. No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.The Moroccan king has urged China to play an active role in encouraging all sides in the Middle East conflict to restart peace talks. At a meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, the king described the situation in the Middle East as 'sinking into a deadlock'. Jiang said that the key to the problem was the 're-establishment of the legal rights of the Palestinian nation' and that China was willing to work with the Arab nations to help maintain dialogue to resolve the situation. The following is the text of report by Liu Dongkai, entitled: 'Jiang Zemin meets with Morocco's King Mohammed VI' by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)Beijing, 5 February: Chairman Jiang Zemin met with Moroccan King Mohammed VI in the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. The leaders exchanged sincere opinions on bilateral relations and major international and regional topics of interest, and reached a broad consensus in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.Jiang Zemin warmly welcomed King Mohammed to China, and expressed his pleasure at once again seeing the King in Beijing. He said: Your excellency is the first Moroccan sovereign to visit China in the 44 years since China and Morocco established diplomatic relations, and I believe that your excellency's visit will become a milestone in Sino-Moroccan relations.Jiang Zemin gave high marks to relations between China and Morocco. He said: The friendship between China and Morocco is deep and long. In their long-term struggle to obtain their independence and be liberated, to protect their national sovereignty and dignity, and to promote world peace and development, the people of both nations have always shown each other sympathy and support. There has been sincere, friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation based on equality on matters involving economic development and construction of the nation. Today, we once more take a look backwards at history, standing here at a strategic height, and take long-term interests as our point of departure. We set the direction for the relations between our two nations in the new century. Jiang Zemin suggested that China and Morocco should continue their joint efforts on the following points:1. Establishing a long-term, stable friendly relationship of cooperation between the two nations for the future.2. Promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.3. Enhancing coordination and discussion to jointly protect the rights and interests of developing nations and protect world peace.Jiang Zemin praised Morocco's long-standing adherence to the viewpoint that there is but one China, and thanked Morocco for its support of China in the area of human rights. Jiang gave an excellent assessment of the Moroccan government and the king's hard work and successes in maintaining political stability, bringing about sustained economic growth and securing the welfare and happiness of the people, and expressed his heartfelt congratulations to Morocco on its continued progress down the road of national construction.When discussing bilateral trade relations, Jiang Zemin stressed that the Chinese government has always placed great emphasis on friendly cooperation with Morocco. He said: In recent years, both sides have enlarged the channels for cooperation on a daily basis, and diversified the forms of cooperation. This has been done to bring about positive social and economic benefits to both sides. China will work hard with Morocco on the basis of equality and mutual benefit to strongly enhance trade cooperation between the two nations, and to bring about common development.King Mohammed expressed his thanks to Jiang Zemin for the invitation to visit China and for the warm welcome he had received after arriving in Beijing. He gave fulsome praise to China's success in reform and opening, and said that in the 10 years since he had last visited China, earthshaking changes have taken place in China.King Mohammed gave a very positive assessment to the relationship between China and Morocco.

He said: Currently, the Middle East is sinking into a deadlock. I hope that China will play an active role in stimulating all the parties involved to quickly find a resolution, and to break through the deadlock and resume the process of negotiation.Jiang Zemin thanked the king for his summary. He emphasized that the key to the Middle East problem is a reasonable resolution of the Palestinian problem, and re-establishment of the legal rights of the Palestinian nation.

"2094","China","Construction of the holy town, Touba (duplicate: 1947)","2011","false","Since the resumption of diplomatic ties between China and Senegal in 2005, there has been acceleration of cooperation in all sectors between the two countries.As a friend of China in the 1960s and 1970s, Senegal then benefited a lot from the Chinese support.Senegal's former presidents Leopold Sedar Senghor and Abdou Diouf had facilitated the arrival in Senegal of Chinese investors.The Chinese agricultural and medical missions were highly appreciated in several Senegalese localities because of their expertise.The construction by the Chinese of the 'friendship' stadium in Senegal which later became 'Leopold Sedar Senghor' stadium in 1980s, helped to take this friendship to a higher level.The breaking off of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1996 created some inconvenience to their people. However, Dakar and Beijing later decided to resume their diplomatic relations in October 2005.In January 2006, the signing of the first agreement after the reopening of the Chinese Embassy in Dakar marked the return of a 'big friend' in Senegal.The two countries have adopted a new model of cooperation which is christened 'the win-win partnership.'REVIVAL OF POLITICAL RELATIONSThe resumption of Sino-Senegalese relations was materialized on the political front through the revial of talks between Beijing and Dakar.The missions, visits and exchanges between the senior authorities in the two countries increased.President Abdoulaye Wade and members of his government made several visits to Beijing. Chinese President Hu Jintao also visited Senegal in February 2009.Several accords were signed between the two governments for the completion of several large scale projects such as the construction of the Grand National Theater, the rehabilitation of the 11 regional stadiums and training of Senegalese farmers.In addition, the Chinese government, through the Import-Export Bank of China, gave Senegal several preferential loans to carry out projects in several sectors such as energy production.CONSTRUCTION OF QUALITY AND MODERN INFRASTRUCTURESituated in the Dakar city center, the Grand National Theater has been an attraction to all passers-by.Constructed by the Chinese through aid from the Chinese government, this cultural building will enable Senegal to have a modern cultural infrastructure.During the official opening of the building in April 2010, Senegalese President Wade said it was a demonstration of the depth of ties between the two countries.China is in the process of revolutionizing Senegalese sports with the construction and rehabilitation of 11 regional stadiums. Two stadiums were already been completed and handed over to Senegal in 2009 while nine others are still under construction.Another example of Sino-Senegalese cooperation is the construction of the holy town of Touba (East) by the Chinese group, Henan China.In the health sector, Senegal's Health Minister Modou Diagne Fada and Chinese Ambassador to Senegal Gong Yuanxing recently laid the foundation stone for the construction of a children's hospital in Diamniadio town, 40 km north of Senegalese capital Dakar.The health minister said that this modern hospital which will have a 130 bed capacity, will cost 70 million yuan.CHINESE SUPPORT FOR SENEGAL'S ENERGY SECTORConfronted by a crisis in the energy sector with frequent power cuts, Senegal has benefited from the Chinese aid to resolve this problem.China will participate in the modernization of Dakar's electricity network. By 2015, the Senegalese capital city will have sufficient energy supply.In 2010, the Senegalese national electricity company (SENELEC) signed two agreements worth 69.1 billion Fcfa with the Chinese electricity company CMEC to improve electricity distribution within Dakar and its environs.DYNAMISM OF BILATERAL COMMERCIAL EXCHANGESA Senegalese newspaper Le Soleil recently reported that China has intensified bilateral commercial exchanges with the country.Chinese products are visible in almost all Senegalese markets and China has now become a destination of choice for Senegalese economic operators.FIGHT AGAINST FOOD INSECURITY AND IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING CONDITIONSOn the agricultural front, Chinese agricultural experts who settled in Senegal in 2006 have helped Senegalese farmers on ways to fight against food insecurity.In the transport sector, China and Senegal signed a cooperation accord on the opening of the Senbus bus park. This accord also envisioned the setting up of a car assembly plant in Senegal.During the same year, theSenegalese authorities announced the arrival of 200 buses assembled in China to help resolve difficulties that were being experienced by the public transport company, 'Dakar dem dikk.'China also helped Senegal in the organization of international meetings. In this regard, China gave Senegal 50 vehicles during the 11th session of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OCI) which was held in Dakar between March 7-14, 2008.The vehicles were handed over to help in the transportation of foreign dignitaries.During the third edition of the Global Negro Festival which was held in Dakar between Dec. 10-31,2010, Senegal received additional 50 vehicles from China.For the past several years,China and Senegal have maintained good momentum in further developing bilateral ties.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Senegal","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNEWS00020110817e78h004s9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"2166","China","Construction of power stations (Duplicate)","2005","false","The Shandong Electric Power Construction Corporation, a subsidiary of the Chinese Shandong Power Group, has recently signed a letter of intention with the Sudanese authorities for the construction of three electricity power stations. It concerns a coal fired 500 MW power station in Port Sudan and two 300 MW gas fired power station, situated respectively in El Bagair (suburbs of Khartoum) and Al Fula (Kordofan). These projects represent an investment of $483.3 million and could be supported by the Export Import Bank of China. However, the negotiations have not yet been completed and a number of problems remain to be settled (the precise nature of the contract, cost of the project and conditions attached to the credit). There is one important point of disagreement between the government of Sudan and the Chinese company. Khartoum wants Shandong to build these power stations under a BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer) contract over 25 years.The Chinese company for its part considers that running these power stations for 25 years involves taking a risk on the future political stability of the country and on the conditions of their economic viability. It does not want to take such a risk and therefore proposed building them under an EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) arrangement. Discussions will therefore have to continue for some time between the Chinese company and the authorities of Sudan before this project can be materialised.

"2133","China","Preferential Loan for uranium project (Duplicate of 256)","2008","false","'NIAMEY, April 24 (Reuters) - China has granted Niger a $95 million preferential loan to boost a uranium mining project the two countries have in the West African state, Niger's government said late on Thursday. Niger's government is a 33 percent joint venture partner with the China National Uranium Corporation (SINO-U) in the SOMINA uranium mining operation, due to come on line by 2010, with an annual output of about 700 tonnes. The entry into Niger of Chinese miners and Cameco Corp , the world's top uranium producer that now has a stake in GoviEx, a company with local exploration rights, follows years of dominance by French nuclear group Areva . 'China has agreed to the Export-Import Bank of China granting Niger a preferential loan of 650 million yuan ($95.22 million) with a view to supporting the SOMINA uranium exploration project,' Niger's government said in a statement broadcast on state television late on Thursday. Niger will have to pay 2 percent interest on the loan, which must be paid back within 15 years, a government source said. China has committed to investing some $300 million in the project, which is at Azelik, in the northern Agadez region, where Areva has mining projects but the Niger government has also been battling a two-year uprising by Tuareg rebels. Niger already has two significant uranium mines providing 7.5 percent of global output from Africa's highest-grade uranium ores, according to the World Nuclear Association website. Earlier this year, Areva said it had won a licence to operate the Imouraren mine, which would more than double Niger's uranium output to make it the second largest producer in the world.

He added that Sino-Sudanese relations have withstood the test of time and change, and the two sides have conducted good cooperation in all fields. China appreciates Sudanese government's one-China stance and its support for China's reunification cause, Hu stressed. He also expressed gratitude for the support by Sudanese government towards China on the human rights issue, and said that China is ready to improve the relations with Sudan in the new century. On Sino-Sudanese trade relations, Hu said the trade volume between China and Sudan has increased and the cooperation has expanded in recent years. He particularly mentioned the successful cooperation between the two countries in the petroleum field, and cited it an example of friendly cooperation among the developing countries. Hu said that China is ready to expand areas for bilateral cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and effectiveness. Taha said the Sudanese government has attached importance to developing relations with China, and thanks China for its support to Sudan's national independence and territorial integrity. He also expressed gratitude for China's economic and technology assistance towards Sudan, and its reduction of debt owned by the African nation. Sudan hopes to further its cooperation with China in all fields especially in the area of petroleum, he added. Taha reaffirmed Sudan's one-China stance, and expressed his appreciation for China's efforts in promoting Sino-African cooperation. Hu Jintao said the international situation tends to ease on the whole, but hegemonism and power politics still exist, thus peace and development face challenges. Globalization is bound to intensify, Hu said, adding that economic globalization promotes the world economy, and will widen the gap between the rich and the poor. The Chinese vice-president urged the developing countries to work together to promote the establishment of a just and reasonable international political and economic order. He said that China is ready to work with Sudan to improve peace and development of mankind. Source: Xinhua news agency, Beijing, in English 1247 gmt 29 Mar 01.

"2136","China","(NOT A PROJECT?) China to invest further $3 billion in Nigeria","2009","true","'The global economic crisis may have forced other nations to put their African investments on hold, but not China.This week, the Nigerian government announced that China would double its current direct investment from a total of $3 billion to $6 billion, most of that in Nigeria's oil sector. Last week, the government of Guinea - where a coup brought a military captain to power last December - announced that a Chinese firm planned to invest $7 billion in oil and mining infrastructure in return for preferential treatment in all mining projects in Guinea.China's increasing investment in Africa has raised concerns among human rights activists and others who warn that Chinese money props up regimes such as those in Zimbabwe, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo who are either undemocratic, corrupt, or carry out mass-scale human rights crimes, or combinations of the above. Yet many African leaders applaud Chinese investment, saying that they create jobs, infrastructure, and business opportunities in African countries where Western companies fear to tread.'Huge Chinese investment in African companies and infrastructure is helping Africa develop. The Chinese bring what Africa needs: investment and money for governments and companies,' Rwandan President Paul Kagame told reporters for the German business daily Handelsblatt earlier in October. 'European and American involvement has not brought Africa forward,' President Kagame added, complaining of trade barriers erected by the West.China's long-stated policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of its African partners plays well here in Africa and is a stark contrast to the starchy human-rights focus of many post- colonial European nations and of the United States. While Western nations balk at investing in a country like Zimbabwe, where state security agencies round up, beat, and sometimes kill opposition members and human rights activists, the Chinese are happy to do business. They also sell arms to those regimes.Arms for ZimbabweConsider China's arms deal with Zimbabwe, which went largely unnoticed until June 2008, when South African trade unionists refused to unload a cargo ship carrying the weapons in Durban harbor (Zimbabwe is landlocked). The Chinese ship eventually unloaded the arms in Angola and Zimbabwean planes carried them the rest of the way to Harare.'The Chinese ought to be held accountable for that, whether you'e got an embargo by the UN or not,' says Francis Kornegay, a senior researcher at the Center for Policy Studies in Johannesburg. 'On things like that, the Chinese don't like to be taking the heat, in the limelight, and South Africa ought to be able to get China to agree that nobody should be sending arms to Zimbabwe.'But despite the expected 'tougher stand' of President Jacob Zuma toward Zimbabwe, no African nation has stood up to either the Chinese or the Zimbabwean government. 'There is no leadership on the continent. And China takes advantage of that,' Mr. Kornegay said.China has an advantage over Western countries who keep their government aid and their business interests separate, at least on paper. When a US-based mining company makes an offer to pay for the rights to exploit a mine in, say, the Democratic Republic of Congo, it does so completely on its own. But when a Chinese firm - which is, after all, owned by the Chinese government - bids on the same project, it can also promise significant Chinese government aid for building roads and water systems and electrical projects, a complete package that no Western private company can compete with.The Chinese government is also flush with cash. So while other governments have simply pulled back from development aid projects, China has actually boosted investment, with $552 million in the first half of 2009. In May, Beijing announced that it would increase its China-Africa Development Fund - which has invested $400 million in Africa since 2006 - by an additional $2 billion.Trade between Africa and China is now worth about $100 billion per year, most of it generated by mineral and oil sales. That's about 10 times the level it was in the 1980s. Chinese investment in Sudan - a country accused by the International Criminal Court of war crimes and mass murder in its six-year civil conflict in the Darfur region - allows China to take home more than 60 percent of all the oil that Sudan produces. The arrangement works well for Sudan, or at least for the government in Khartoum. More than 80 percent of Khartoum's revenues come from oil.Faced with no-questions-asked Chinese investment on one hand and the West's penny-pinching aid-with-a-lecture on the other makes competing with China in Africa a tough task, German President Horst Kohler admitted in a June meeting with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. 'For this reason, Africans believe that China is better than the West because for us we raise issues regarding democracy, corruption and human rights,' the German president said in Berlin.(c) Copyright 2009.

A private investor from China has been identified.Brigadier General Peter Tembo, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Communication and Transport in Zambia, told The EastAfrican in Lusaka last week that Zambia and Tanzania had agreed to concession the railway firm to a Chinese investor who will be guaranteed by the Chinese government.'The Tanzania Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) is overseeing the privatisation of Tazara, with the committee from the three partner states working on the price assessment,' he said, adding that some members of the privatisation committee had already been drawn from Tanzania, Zambia and China.Among other things, the Commission was expected to come up with an appropriate modality of privatising Tazara, with the two options being selling or leasing it out.Recently, a Chinese delegation visited Tanzania and Zambia for consultations with various stakeholders on the concessioning of Tazara.Maua Daftari, Deputy Minister for Infrastructure Development, said recently that the Tanzania and Zambia governments had identified a Chinese firm with the capacity to run the 1,860 kilometre railway profitably but stopped short of disclosing the firm's name.Ms Daftari said that Tanzania and Zambia had agreed to give priority to the Chinese firm after taking into account China's role in building the railway line and sustaining it over the past three decades.The railway line, constructed in the 1970s, runs from Dar-es-Salaam to Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia. Tazara has been experiencing declining profits through technical and managerial problems.Early this month, Tazara contracted an international firm to rehabilitate 18 main line locomotives under a $10 million financing arrangement secured through Konkola Copper Mines.

It was one of the first mines to be privatised in 1999.Since the acquisition of the firm, there has been heavy investment,which has seen the rehabilitation and modernisation of the old copper concentrator.The concentrator will have a capacity of producing 42 per cent copper concentrate grade from 1.8 per cent, making it superior to any other copper produced in Zambia.Currently, average grade for concentrates produced in Zambia is 35 per cent, most of which is exported to China.Source: Zambia Daily Mail website, Lusaka, in English 15 Dec 08a94b0e35","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020081215e4cf001xj&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

It is a requirement for all major investors in Zambia which offers them additional incentives and safeguards their investments.  'As Dangote Industries Limited's investment is among the largest investments outside the traditional mining sector and Chinese investments in Zambia, it has understandably attracted a lot of attention,' he said, adding 'The fact that it is an African investment also generates a great deal of interest. Let me assure you that we are equal to the task; we have similar investments in more than 10 other African countries. We spent about nine months negotiating and I am delighted that we are now at a point where all parties are agreeable to the deal.'According to Dangote, the proposed cement plant in Zambia with an installed capacity of 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum, will be up and running 27 months from February/March 2011. He said DIL's choice of Zambia for this multi-million dollar investment is quite strategic, noting that the World Bank had in 2010 named Zambia as one of the world's fastest economically reforming countries. Zambia, he recalled, is also rated as one of the most highly urbanised countries in sub-Saharan Africa with 44 percent of the population concentrated in a few urban areas.Document AFNWS00020101213e6cd0004","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020101213e6cd000v4&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"2388","China","2D Petroleum Seismic Surveys (Duplicate of 137)","2003","false","'Exploration of the remote Tenere Block in eastern Niger is back on the cards after Canada's TG World Energy and Chinese state giant China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) settled a bitter disagreement.CNPC International will operate the block and carry the costs of Canadian minnow TG World for a 20% stake in the four-year exploratory program, plus offer $1 million in compensation. The agreement is still subject to government approval.The dispute stemmed from the Niger government's decision last November to hand over the 8.6 million acre Tenere exploration permit to CNPC, just a week after terminating TG's own lease on the acreage -- its sole global asset -- ahead of its formal expiry.TG protested and accused its former Chinese negotiating partner of breaking confidentially agreements, as another CNPC affiliate, China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corp., had earlier discussed a farm-in deal (IOD Jan.14,p1).After TG World initiated international and local legal action, the two sides held talks in Niger and China in June, and the Canadian firm later said an 'amicable settlement' appeared to have been reached.The new $55 million work program calls for a minimum of 1,500 kilometers of seismic surveys before the end of the year, followed by three exploration wells. The Tenere contract is structured on rolling three-year terms, each of which would include further exploration well commitments.Tenere is adjacent to the Agadem contract area held by Exxon Mobil and Malaysia's Petronas, which has found oil and gas discoveries in five pools totaling 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. Operator Petronas now plans to drill three more Agadem wells to gauge the threshold required for an export development project. According to TG, Tenere should lie on the same trend, and its previous seismic work suggested 10 prospects large enough to hold over 500 million barrels of oil equivalent each.As one of the poorest countries on the planet, Niger has been keen for oil exploration to get back on track after years of raised hopes and sporadic drilling stretching back to the 1950s.Interest has picked up since an Exxon-led consortium completed a 1,050-km crude export pipeline from the large Doba fields in neighboring Chad through to Cameroon and the coast (IOD Oct.3,p4).Nonetheless, transportation remains the key obstacle should any large finds be made in this barren and remote Saharan nation, with Exxon admitting it would require a find of at least 1 billion barrels to justify a 1,000-km plus link to the Chad pipeline, or a new line crossing North Africa to the Mediterranean.

"10819","China","US$30 Million Grant (duplicate)","2007","false","Oct 05, 2007 (New Era/All Africa Global Media ia COMTEX) -- The Chinese Ambassador to Namibia, Liang Yinzhu, on Tuesday leaves after serving in the country for four years. He leaves after a rich career in diplomacy in Africa. He worked as an ambassador in Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe and Namibia. New Era met him on Wednesday, and he had much to say about his time in office and commented on areas of cooperation between the two countries.Q: Could you describe the relationship between China and Namibia?A: Far as they are from each other geographically, China and Namibia established their traditional friendship in the 1960s and then made it deep rooted. When the Namibian people were struggling for independence, China stood firmly on their side and provided them with moral and material support by overcoming its own difficulties. The two countries established diplomatic relations the day after Namibia gained independence.The friendly cooperation between the two countries has ever since been developing in a steady and sound manner. In recent years, there have been frequent exchanges of high level isits, which greatly helps deepen mutual political trust and promotes cooperation in all fields with marked results.China significantly increased its assistance to Namibia and a number of projects were completed. His Excellency Hu Jintao, President of the Peoples Republic of China, pledged to provide Namibia with 1 billion yuan in concessionary loans, US$100 million in preferential export buyer's credit, 30 million yuan in grants and 30 million yuan in interest-free loans during his isit to Namibia in February this year.Also during this isit, President Jintao undertook to build two rural schools and a hospital. The two sides are now discussing the modalities of the financial assistance.Trade olume between the two countries increased rapidly and bilateral cooperation in such areas as economy, trade, jurisdiction, education, health, etc has been on the rise. More and more cities in the two countries got twinned with more commercial and cultural exchanges between the two peoples. Some Chinese businessmen came to Namibia to invest, who made contributions to enriching local markets, improving the living standards of the locals and arresting unemployment and poverty.In accordance with the MoU on the implementation plan for organised Group Travel by Chinese citizens to Namibia signed during President Jintao's isit, Chinese travel agencies will start organising tourist groups to Namibia as of October 15.In a word, acting on the Beijing Declaration and Plan of Action of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held last year, the two sides are making concerted efforts to instil igour and itality into bilateral relations, which will greatly benefit the two countries and the two peoples.

Kampala, Apr 06, 2001 (New Vision/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX)-Small and big scale industries making belts, are to benefit from Chinese simple and cheap technology that can boost output, and become more marketable. The technology involves an embossing machine used for cutting and design. Previously, local man'facturers used to design their products manually by banging, which is tedious and not cost effective. However, the embossing machine from China, is able to cut and design between 100 to 150 belts per hour. The Uganda's Ambassador to China, Phillip Idro, who introduced the technology, said China unlike Uganda depends mainly on the smallscale industries. He said in China, a total of 150 million people are in this sector. He said this constitutes 30% of the government's tax returns. Idro said there is need for small scale industries to integrate for the efficient utilisation of resources. 'The concept of industrialisation must be improved. If we need to industrialise we must pay attention. My aim is to improve on the industrialisation and I am looking at both small and big entrepreneurs,' he said. Idro was briefing journalists at the Training and Common Facility (TCFC) in industrial area recently.

Bukenya thanked the Chinese for investing in Uganda and asked them to help Uganda produce finished fabrics rather than unfinished ones like lint. 'I want Uganda to produce cloth like the one you are wearing rather than just lint. You can help us turn this country into a weaving centre for East, Central and Southern Africa. That way, farmers will grow more cotton and earn more money,' he said. 'We are currently buying fabric in order to use our quota under the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act. We want as many investors as possible to make fabric in Uganda. The Government will support Lira Spinning Mills to achieve this,' he said.

"10798","China","Chinese Traditional Medicine practicioners in Tunisia (Duplicate of 14020)","2006","false","MEDICAL TEAMS WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER HELP  By Zhang Feng  551 words2 November 2006China DailyCHNDLYEnglishCopyright 2006 China Daily Information Company. All rights reserved.  China will continue to improve healthcare services in African countries by sending medical teams.  The country will continue to enhance medical services co-operation with African countries, send medical teams to countries in need, strengthen prevention and control of major infectious diseases including malaria, and train local talent, said Mao Qun'an, spokesman of the Ministry of Health.  Speaking at a press conference last month, Mao said since the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation was launched in 2000, China has made great efforts to train African doctors in traditional medicine, clinical medicine, disease prevention and control, and management of rural medical services.  Among all aspects of co-operation, medical teams have been a highlight, officials said.  According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, from April 1963 to the end of 2005, China had sent 15,000 people in medical teams to 47 African countries, offering 170 million treatments.  Currently, at least 950 doctors and nurses from different regions of the country are working in 36 African countries, Mao said.  'Chinese doctors have been welcomed by local residents. More than 600 doctors have been awarded various nation-level medals by local governments,' Mao said.  The first Chinese medical team was sent to Algeria in 1963, and it was seen off by then Premier Zhou Enlai.  Medical aid for African countries is different from other forms of economic support, said Li Wanshan, a senior official from the International Co-operation Department of the Ministry of Health.  Medical teams are jointly organized by the two sides. The teams mainly provide free services, funded by the Chinese Government.  These doctors must be good at medical treatment and foreign languages, Li said.  Generally, they work for at least two years. And the hospitals or clinics where they work almost all have poor medical equipment and a small number of doctors, and are unable to meet medical demand.  There are nearly 100 doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in Africa, offering treatments such as acupuncture.  By the middle of this October, Chinese acupuncturists in Tunisian capital Tunis had treated at least 20,000 patients over the past two years, Xinhua News Agency reported.  Acupuncture can help treat stroke sufferers for a much lower cost than western medicine, experts say.  In Tanzania, TCM has been used by Chinese medical teams for 19 years to treat 10,000 HIV/AIDS patients.  Compared with Western medicines that are usually too expensive for African people, TCM is much cheaper and sometimes more effective in treating certain diseases, said Fang Shuting, deputy director of the State Administration of TCM.  Nearly 1,000 African students have come to China to learn TCM since the 1960s.  In Africa, Chinese doctors often have to deal with diseases that have virtually disappeared in China.  For example, doctors have to treat many patients with rupture of the uterus, which is hardly seen in China nowadays, said Zhang Fengru, a Chinese doctor who worked in Morocco.  Since 1975, China has sent 109 medical teams with 1,200 doctors to Morocco. Currently, 121 Chinese doctors are working there.  On April 25, 2006, President Hu Jintao met doctors there as he visited the country and encouraged them to work harder for African people.

This means, at a unit cost averaging $14,000, theinvestment ranges anywhere upto $3.2million (Ush5.44 billion).One distinct feature of these cars is the 50,000 kilometers warranty and the pre-installed alarms.The warranty ensures that any buyer is free to access the services of the dealers for as long as they are still within the 50,000 kilometre range.Officials at Walusimbi's garage are tight lipped about the identity of the Chinese car partners, who are expected in the country in a few weeks,Kyazze says they are targeting government institutions which include ministries, commissions, parastatals and Non Governmental Organisations. 'We hope by May 2008, we shall get the first batch of these vehicles. We have samples already in town which have touched the ground,' said Kyazze.A comprehensive launch has been delayed because the company is looking at sustainability, technical conditions, compliance to African specifications, fuel consumption in litres, vehicle affordability, spares, after sales service requirements, training of personnel, and promotional strategy among others.Walusimbis's garage is planning to sweep the entire East African market with these brand new cars.According to the officials, because the cars will have similar technology to the Toyota brand, servicing of the China car will be possible in garages that service Toyota vehicles.Document AFNWS00020080324e43o0017r","Manufacturing and Industry","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Uganda","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020080324e43o0017r&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"11453","China","US$100m buyers' credit (duplicate)","2007","false","Chinese benefaction to Namibia in particular held steadfast on Monday when President Hu Jintao announced a N$1-billion soft loan and also offered N$60 million in the form of an interest-free loan, a grant and dozens of scholarships.Hu made the announcement in Windhoek during the fifth leg of his marathon tour of eight African countries some of which have received substantial sums of money in aid while in the same vein benefiting from debt-cancellation from the Asian giant.Hu said during talks with President Hifikepunye Pohamba that China would further avail US$100 million in buyers' credit and build youth-training centres in Namibia.Because Namibia is among the few African countries officially designated a tourism destination by the Chinese government, some of the money would go towards boosting its market share of the rapidly expanding Chinese tourism industry, particularly group tours.During the official talks on Monday that preceded the signing ceremony for the soft loans and other bilateral aid, Pohamba told his counterpart that Namibia has numerous opportunities for investment in the fields of agriculture, tourism, aquaculture, mining, energy, technology and infrastructure and human development.'In this regard, we are inviting Chinese entrepreneurs to come and form joint ventures and other business partnerships with their Namibian counterparts for the mutual benefit of both countries,' Pohamba said at the meeting held with Hu at a local hotel.He assured Chinese investors that they have nothing to fear because Namibia offers a conducive business environment in line with the Reciprocal Treaty on the Promotion and Protection of Investment signed by the two nations.China's tremendous economic and social growth, elevating it to a global economic powerhouse, was also commended by President Pohamba who said Namibia 'would like to emulate' the Asian nation's successes and learn from 'your tremendous experience'.'Namibia needs partners in the promotion and realization of industrial development, investment and local value addition which are all critical for the achievement of our national development goals as set out in our National Development Plans and Vision 2030,' the Head of State said at a meeting that included several cabinet ministers.He said the recent Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation reached common ground on major international political and economic issues, especially on the reform of the United Nations and the maintenance of international peace and security.'Namibia supports the China-Africa policy, which is based on peaceful co-existence and anchored on the values of sincerity, equality and mutual common development,' he said.And Namibia being a member of the Troika of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security, shall continue to support regional efforts aimed at conflict prevention.And equally important Pohamba reaffirmed his government's full support 'for the one-China policy and to reiterate our position that Taiwan is an integral part of China.'Hu said the cooperation between Namibia and China has been growing steadfastly in the fields of politics, economics, education, public health and culture.Since taking office in March 2005, Pohamba has actively promoted bilateral ties with China, and according to the news agency AP, trade between the two nations in the first 11 months of 2006 amounted to US$240 million, an increase of 103 percent from 2005.Hu, whose 130-strong delegation included his wife Liu Yongqing and several senior ministers and high-ranking officials, left yesterday morning for South Africa.//CHINA has offered Government one billion Namibian dollars as a concessional loan over a three-year period until 2010, plus another N$720 million as a credit line, The Namibian established yesterday.The offer was made on Monday during bilateral talks shortly before Chinese President Hu Jintao wrapped up his brief visit of barely 23 hours to Namibia yesterday morning.After talks with Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba on Monday, a new grant and an interest-free loan agreement worth N$60 million were signed at a brief public signing ceremony.The state visit culminated with a banquet held in honour of Hu and his 130-member delegation.The Permanent Secretary in the Finance Ministry confirmed the huge amount yesterday afternoon.'The N$1 billion is in the form of a concessional loan, which means that Namibia can use those funds on projects it will decide on,' Calle Schlettwein told The Namibian.'The second offer of US$ 00 million (about N$720 million) is a concessional credit line.This will enable our Government to acquire goods, services and equipment from China,' Schlettwein added.He said Government still had to decide whether it would accept the offer.'We will then have to decide on which projects we will use those funds and then negotiate the loan terms,' he explained.After Hu's departure, the two countries issued a joint communique, but the loan offer was not mentioned.Namibia and China expressed their satisfaction with the strong ties that exist between them as well as political trust and good co-operation.'Both heads of state recognised the achievements made in trade and agreed to work together to strengthen co-operation in mining, agriculture, tourism, manufacturing and human resources development,' the communique stated.Both countries now have four agreements in place: trade and economic co-operation, establishing a joint commission on trade and economic co-operation, a reciprocal treaty for the protection of trade and investments for both Chinese and Namibian businesspeople in China and Namibia.The fourth agreement was signed in Beijing last November during the Forum for China-Africa Co-operation (Focac).The Namibia Investment Centre and a similar institution in China, the China investment Promotion Agency (CIPA), agreed to promote and facilitate investment between the two countries.After Hu left, some 35 Chinese businesspeople who are part of his official delegation remained behind in Windhoek for a business presentation on Namibia as an investment destination.It was organised by the Namibia Investment Centre and the Ministry of Trade and Industry and some 50 Namibian captains of industry attended the session.Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko called on the Chinese executives to form joint ventures with their Namibian counterparts and to invest in local value addition of the country's raw materials.'It is imperative that during all your deliberations and interactions, value addition should become your central strategy of engagement,' Ngatjizeko urged.//Mar 27, 2007 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --GOVERNMENT will engage a Chinese software company to install an electronic management system for the public service.Cabinet approved that the Office of the Prime Minister could secure funding under a concessional loan agreement signed last month between China and Namibia during the state visit of Chinese president Hu Jintao for the implementation of an Electronic Documentation and Records Management System (EDRMS) across the public service.This is viewed as a critical project in terms of existing e-governance policy directives.China offered over N$1 billion as a loan for projects to be identified by Namibia.The EDRMS project team evaluated various appropriate software solutions and found that the system offered by Chinese outfit CA-China SS Software Technology would be best suited for the requirements of the Namibian public service.'The system is not only government user friendly, but also offers easy-to-use interfaces and robust application software that will link up with already familiar public service platforms to ensure records and archival compliance,' Information Minister Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah told reporters last week.Cabinet therefore endorsed the EDRMS under the auspices of the Office of the Prime Minister on condition that it complies with tender procedures.Cabinet instructed the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Commission to discuss the conditions, terms, modality of accessing the preferential loan and credit facility to finance the EDRMS and other priority projects in Namibia with the Chinese Government.Cabinet also granted approval for the arrangement of the grant and the use of the concessional loans for the EDRMS project by the Export-Import Bank of China, subject to concurrence by the Chinese Government.The company CA-CSS is a joint venture formed by New York-based commercial software associates (CA) and China National Computer Software   Technology Service Corporation (CS S).The primary goal of the joint venture was to explore the huge potential presented by the Chinese software market by leveraging the resources and expertise from both parties.The company's head office is in Beijing, China.//Bilateral trade aside, the visit to Namibia in 2007 of Chinese President Hu Jintao during his historic tour of several African countries, resulted in China offering Namibia concessional loans amounting to RMB1 billion. And it also generously extended a preferential line of credit that is interest-free to the tune of US$100 million.From the concessional loan, an amount of RMB41 million was used for the procurement of software and for the implementation of the e-governance project for Namibia, while RMB300 million was used for the procurement of X-ray equipment from China.RMB645 million from the concessional loan funded three developmental projects including for the implementation of one of the phases of the Northern Railway Line as well as the upgrading of the Oshakati State Hospital in northern Namibia, which she noted: 'was very run down and needed to be upgraded'.Part of these funds was used to give a facelift and expansion of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), whose facilities were built during the colonial era.'The Namibian side is satisfied with the implementation of these projects,' she said.She said since her deployment as Chinese Ambassador to Namibia, she has worked tirelessly to ensure that the eight areas of cooperation measures promised by President Hu Jintao at the China Africa Summit held in Beijing in 2006 such as the provision of full support to African countries, that such as assistance to rural schools and hospitals are fulfilled.'Since I came to Namibia, I have been working very hard to implement the eight measures promised by President Hu Jintao at the China-Africa Beijing Summit. Since my arrival, my job was to consolidate different relations and to further the friendship and areas of cooperation. Since my arrival, our mutual trust has grown,' she said.The eight measures announced by the Chinese president included the doubling of grant assistance and providing US$3 billion soft loans and US$2 billion preferential buyer's credit in three years setting up a China-Africa development fund which will be injected with US$5 billion to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Africa.Other measures are: building a conference centre for the African Union, cancelling debts owed by heavily indebted and the least developed African countries, further opening up China's vast market to Africa by largely increasing the number of African export items to China that receive zero-tariff treatment and strengthening cooperation in the fields of agriculture, human resource enhancement, health and education.The inception of the Forum of China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) brought tangible benefits to Namibia such as the building of the regional council buildings in Rundu and Outapi, the New State House, the fishery laboratory at Kamutjonga Inland Fisheries Institute in Kavango, the Defence Academy (Okahandja), and the Youth Training Centre.China also availed grants amounting to RMB20 million and it helped to fund a large hospital at Omuthiya where a groundbreaking ceremony has occurred.She said China has provided over 300 training opportunities to Namibians in various fields while at the same time it has seconded a medical team at the Katutura State Hospital. There are several Chinese experts working at grassroots level while rural women and youth empowerment projects have all benefited from China's generosity.At current exchange rates, US$1 is equivalent to RMB6.8.//No18, 2011 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE Ministry of Works and Transport has drawn Government into taking a Chinese loan that was rejected two years ago as 'onerous' in a road-building contract that has also bypassed official open tender process.The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, George Simataa, told The Namibian that the construction of the two roads - between Omakange and Ruacana and between Omafo and Outapi in northern Namibia - will be funded with a Chinese loan but that the Ministry of Finance is yet to apply or approve the loan. The roads are expected to cost about N$1 billion.The Namibian has it on good authority that the loan in question is the same controversial package that the Government ditched in 2009 after Teko Trading, a company owned by two Namibians and a Chinese national now facing corruption charges, was exposed as having received kic-backs of N$120 million from China when the Government bought customs scanning equipment for N$550 million.Teko Trading was said to be the 'local representative' for Nuctech (the Chinese company) although the Ministry of Finance said it had no knowledge of the company's dubious middle-man role.Teko Trading, owned by Public Service Commissioner Teckla Lameck, Kongo Mokaxwa and Chinese national Yung Fan, were supposed to be the 'local representatives' for China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export, and were experted to earn at least 10 per cent 'commission' from the N$1,1 billion tender to complete the 65km northern railway line between Ondangwa and Oshikango.Government dropped that loan agreement, with then Permanent Secretary of Finance Calle Schlettwein calling it 'onerous' and Simataa arguing in documents that the loan was 'risky because of foreign exchange fluctuations'.In a series of e-mails this week, Simataa said two Chinese firms, China Gezhouba Group International Engineering and China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export, have been selected to build the two roads mentioned earlier.While his reply on Tuesday was categorical that the two companies were selected to do the job, after he was asked to elaborate or give definite answers, on Wednesday he changed saying they still have to negotiate and agree on pricing after which they will sign technical and framework agreements.'It is only at that stage that the Ministry of Finance will be approached to apply for a loan from the Chinese Government,' Simataaa said in an e-mail on Wednesday.Asked if it is a condition of the loan that the work be given to Chinese companies he was evasive, saying 'these are Chinese-financed projects. One of their conditions is that the projects should be carried [out] by Chinese firms'.Having already gone ahead with the project, Simataa would also not say for certain whether the ministry was given tender exemption for the work, saying only that proper tender regulations were followed. When pressed if the construction of the two roads were put out on official and open tender Simataa said 'no', citing Chinese loan conditions that Chinese companies be used on the projects. Simataa and the Ministry of Works have been named in research documents as the main culprits in regularly demanding and getting exemptions from public tender regulations.It is unclear why Simataa and the ministry have decided to return to the Chinese loan that they criticised a couple of years ago. There are no indications this time that Teko Trading would be involved.The China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export northern railway line contract was cancelled after it was challenged in the High Court because of alleged tender irregularities.","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Export credits","Unset","","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020070207e327000d2&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The money will also lay roads and electrify slum areas of the capital, Luanda, and also fund rehabilitation of the water supply systems Updated description: On March 2, 2004 the first Credit Accord with the Eximbank of China was signed for a financial package of two billion US Dollars and meant for the financing of projects of Angola's public investment. The first package was implemented in two different phases, with each taking one billion US Dollars. The first phase involved 27 contracts, corresponding to 50 projects, of which 21 have been completed. These projects focused on areas of electricity, water, health, education, public works, each of which taking about 20 percent of the total amount released.The second phase included 13 contracts and 52 projects that are underway. These contracts are in the areas of telecommunications, fisheries, health, education and public works.A contract is near approval to complete the second phase. The contract is called EDEL III, plus another two in final stage of negotiation, also in the sector of electricity and waters.The balance at the end of September 2007, according to the Finance Ministry, is of Usd 7.1 million, of which Usd 1.6 million are for the first phase of the financing and Usd 5.4 million for the second phase.The total amount disbursed until the end of September is Usd 932.9 million, being 733.1 million for the first phase and 199.8 for the second phase.As a result of the positive evaluation made by the two parties concerning the first package of two billion US Dollars, a memorandum of understanding was signed on June 20, 2006, between the Angolan Finance Ministry and China's Eximbank, for the granting of a new financing of the same amount.; Contractor Comment: Tied to the loan, is the agreement that the public tenders for the construction and civil engineering contracts will be awarded primarily to Chinese state-owned enterprises approved by the Chinese government.

'This shows that more and more countries attach importance to the protocol, which is the first international legal instrument to address this issue of humanitarian concern. Now, almost all major land mine producing and using countries have acceded to the protocol.'However, Sha said 58 states are too few. 'Lack of universality will undercut the protocol's significance,' he stressed. 'And no matter how perfect an international legal instrument is, its influence and effectiveness will be limited in the absence of universal participation.'He urged the states to follow the protocol in earnest.Sha announced that the Chinese delegation is strongly opposed to any proposal for further amending the protocol at the current stage.However, he said, states may on a voluntary basis take the lead in implementing technical specifications as outlined in the proposed amendments and provide gratuitous technical assistance, equipment and training to developing countries.On humanitarian de-mining, Sha said that the Chinese government is continuing to cooperate with the Mine Action Service of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations by co-sponsoring another training workshop on de-mining technology from May to June this year, with trainees from Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Rwanda. The Chinese government is pressing rapidly ahead with its donations of de-mining equipment to Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Namibia, he added.'We hope this conference will strengthen exchanges and cooperation on de-mining technologies for reducing and ultimately doing away with land mines Sha said [as received].He emphasized that the Chinese government stands ready to cooperate and exchange with interested countries and inter-organizations in the field of humanitarian de-mining assistance and that China is also willing to join other states and explore ways to streamline the de-mining process.Source: Xinhua news agency, Beijing, in English 1308 gmt 12 Dec 00.

Some Chinese investment in Sierra Leone began as early as the 1970s and gradually gathered pace before the civil war prompted a withdrawal.The Chinese were convinced by the Kabbah government in 2002 to pick up where they had left off and investment gathered momentum again. Initially, this took the form of the rebuilding and refurbishment of a number of mostly Chinese-built buildings in Freetown, including the 60,000-capacity national stadium complex, the Chinese-named Youyi building housing most of the government ministries, and the army headquarters. Perhaps most symbolic, though, has been the rehabilitation of the prominent Bintumani Hotel which was occupied and partly destroyed by rebel forces during the civil war.The Beijing Urban Construction Group, which has agreed a 25-year lease with the government, completed work on the now Chinese-themed 11 acre site in December 2002. Work continues to upgrade the site with plans to build a casino there.Another project the Chinese are revisiting is the Megabass Sugar Complex - the country's only sugar-producing enterprise. China helped to establish the facility, which consists of a sugar-cane farm and mill, in the 1980s and it produced a yearly output of about 6,000 tonnes a year.In January 2003, a lease contract was signed between the government and the Chinese National Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation and production is expected to start again this year.There is also long-standing and increasing interest in other areas of agriculture, such as rice technology where Sierra Leone is making progress toward meeting food production targets. In fisheries too China has a historic presence, two companies having signed contracts of mutual benefit in the mid-80s. China also cites a tractor assembly factory at a former brick works in the east of the capital as one of its big investments.But the real focus of interest is this month's opening of a trade zone in the area of the former National Workshop in the eastern Cline Town district of Freetown. The scheme has involved the specialised refurbishment of a transport depot and metal workshop by China's Henan Guoji.Fifteen or more Chinese companies are eventually to occupy the site. A number already do with activities as diverse as the manufacture of building materials, pharmaceuticals, mattress-making and garage diagnostics.However, Henan Guoji's next project, a Dollars 266m scheme to revitalise the ocean-front of Freetown's Lumley beach area is possibly the most ambitious and certainly largest development project so far planned for the country.An agreement signed with the national tourist board in May 2004 outlines a plan to build a 250-bed luxury hotel complex and conference centre, holiday apartments, town houses and a promenade. Plans in the pipeline also include the building of a mini sports stadium in the southern provincial capital of Bo.The relative boldness of China to jump in where other countries fear to tread has puzzled some commentators, not least in Sierra Leone itself, and has been the subject of speculation over a possible long-term strategic interest in oil.However, the Chinese themselves and government ministers point to a number of factors. Chief among these are the long-standing ties between the two governments, aided by the willingness of Sierra Leone to help China return from the diplomatic wilderness three decades ago. 'Bilateral relations are very good,' says Zhao Zhongqui, the Chinese embassy's economic and commercial counsellor. 'Sierra Leone helped China re-enter the United Nations in the 1970s and the Chinese people will never forget friends like these. They have supported us on many important issues,' he says.Such a relationship seems to provide the bedrock of Chinese investment with all activity appearing to be coordinated at governmental level and facilitated by an series of high-level diplomatic and trade missions. But there is also a sense of a shared understanding of developmental issues, which other countries may lack.Mr Zhongqui adds: 'Both have been developing countries, and now we are helping Sierra Leone to develop quickly to maximise prosperity. Thirty years ago China's gross domestic product per capita was lower than Sierra Leone's is now, so we understand the issues.'Of course Chinese investment does not arise purely out of political and altruistic motivation. Although much of the investment is characterised by Sierra Leoneans as high risk, there appear to be a number of factors at play. The Chinese are clearly taking advantage of a low cost base in terms of cheap basic labour and the low cost of many raw materials. This sometimes has to be weighed against the added cost of Sierra Leone's much publicised infrastructure problems.Perhaps most importantly, the Chinese appear to have a definite 'first in' approach to the different sectors in which they are interested, which has been used to leverage coveted special inducements from the government. Such an approach, combined with similar initiatives in other West African countries, allows Chinese companies an early domination of fledgling domestic and regional markets as well as certain competitive advantages on the wider international stage.'Government policy was very encouraging. We found companies at an early stage were given very preferential policies. The early bird catches the worm.'While Chinese investment is broadly welcomed in Sierra Leone, there are some reservations about the special incentives awarded Chinese companies as well as the limited training of indigenous workers and the extent to which the Chinese might be using the country as a dumping ground for cheap goods.Chris Jasabe, managing director of the Sierra Leone Export Development and Investment Corporation is one of those with concerns. 'All investors should be treated the same,' he says. The problem is that investors come in and take risks and demand concessions that might not be applicable. Then everyone else starts asking for them. We are trying to put a stop to this.' The greatest downside is Sierra Leone's reliance upon Chinese investment and what happens if renewed instability prompts a complete withdrawal.20050214S506.234Document FTFT000020050214e12e0005j'","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Completion","3","Unset","Unset","","Sierra Leone","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=FTFT000020050214e12e0005j&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Internet Securities, Inc. All rights reserved.THE Chinese government will not cut its aid to Uganda despite the credit crunch that has affected developed nations, the foreign affairs minister has said.Milton Olupot reports that Jiechi Yang, who arrived in the country on Tuesday for a two-day state visit, also called on other developed nations to fulfill their promises to help developing countries, especially those in Africa, to fight poverty.Yang and Sam Kutesa, the foreign affairs minister, signed four agreements in loans and support to Uganda worth 531m Yuan (about$75.8m or sh147.9b).The largest share of the loan, will be utilised in the information communication technology and e-government projects. The funds will also be used for economic and technical cooperation between the two governments, construction of a hospital and a government office block, procurement of engineering equipment for Kampala City Council, as well as a grant to the foreign affairs ministry.Yang congratulated Uganda upon her election as a non-permanent member to the UN.He also advised the International Criminal Court to be cautious about the proposal to issue an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar El Bashir.“People should avoid pushing the political process in Sudan. Many partners and the international community have already expressed their position and views and this should be respected.”Yang said because of the warm welcome extended to Chinese business companies in Uganda, moreinvestments would be supported to boost Uganda’s economy, especially the agro-processing industry.Yang’s visit to Uganda was the first leg of his seven-nation tour to Africa and Brazil.Kutesa said there had been a growing relationship between Uganda and China since the 60s and thanked the Chinese government for financial support to Uganda.He said officials from both countries were holding discussions over the construction of a railway line from Uganda to South Sudan.'); //-->","Multisector","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Uganda","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=LQAF000020090115e51e00004&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"12395","China","Chinese write off a portion of Ugandan debt (DUPLICATE)","2008","false","China Sinks Sh304 Billion, Bbumba Wants Moreby David Mugabe408 words30 April 200908:37 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2009 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedKampala, Apr 30, 2009 (New Vision/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- DESPITE over sh304b ($141.5m) sunk into various sectors in Uganda and a $17.5m (sh35b) debt write-off by China in the last one year, the minister of finance, Syda Bbumba, is not impressed by the huge trade imbalance betweenUganda and China.'We are buying more of China and China is buying less,' Bbumba intoned.In 2008, Ugandan exports to China peaked sh40b ($20m) while Uganda imported goods worth about sh580b ($290m).Last year, China wrote off a sh34b ($17m) debt, provided a $120m concessional loan for the government's e-government project and another $11m loan for sanitation equipment to Kampala City Council.The current trade surplus favouring China is bound to increase if an aggressive exports promotion drive is not put in place.Recently, Ben Naturinda, the deputy executive director of the Uganda Exports Promotion Board, said the Chinese government had allowed more than 500 Ugandan products free access to the Chinese market.In 2003, imports from China were a meager $70m (sh140b). Four years later in 2007, the figure had almost quadrupled to $274m (sh548b), according to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. On the other hand, exports from Uganda to the whole Asian market were $48m (sh56b) in 2003. By 2007, the figure had made a slight leap to just $72m (sh144b).At the first joint session of the Uganda-China committee on technical, trade, investment and economic cooperation held in Kampala, Bbumba noted that if China invested in agriculture, Ugandawould increase her mainly food exports to China. Bbumba also proposes that future cooperation between the two governments should focus on empowering Uganda to increase her exports to China.China has, however, continued her support with the recent announcement of sh22.6b ($10.5m) grant to Uganda to be used for various projects yet to be identified and agreed upon by the two countries. During the announcement of the grant, Bbumba appealed for Uganda to be considered as one of five major trade and economic zones in Africa. The promise was made by Chinese president, Hu Jintao, at the November 2006 Sino Africa forum.'This will not only benefit the countries within the region but will also foster regional integration and boost trade in the region and China given Uganda's central location in the great lakes region,' said Bbumba.Document AFNWS00020090430e54u000lh","Debt Relief","","600","Completion","3","Debt forgiveness","Unset","","Uganda","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020090430e54u000lh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"15338","China","Construction of fiber-optic cable infrastructure (Duplicate)","2011","false","Huawei Delivers Fiber Internet Backbone619 words14 October 201111:23 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2011 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedOct 14, 2011 (New Vision/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Uganda Friday inaugurated the second phase of an Internet backbone infrastructure measuring 1,380 kilometers (855 miles), bringing the total amount of fiber optics laid in the country so far to 1,548 km.The second phase of the project comes more than four years after the first phase of the US$106 million National Data Transmission Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) and the Electronic Government Infrastructure (EGI) initiative.The Chinese government sourced and recommended Huawei Technologies to carry out the project. The Uganda NBI is part of an East Africa-wide terrestrial fiber-optic cable, which will, when complete, cover 15,600 km linking the five countries of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi.In the final phase, which begins work in January, 307 km of fiber will be laid from the Uganda capital, Kampala, to the Rwanda border to complete a link from the Kenyan port town of Mombasa.The second phase has linked Uganda to neighbors Kenya in the east and South Sudan to the north.Phase one, which was dogged by technical as well as financial problems, linked all government departments and agencies. James Saka, the executive director of the National Information Technology Authority Uganda (NITA-U), the IT regulator, said the project will help lower the cost of Internet bandwidth for the government and target user groups such as schools, universities, hospitals and research institutions.He said the 24-core, 2.5GB cable, with potential for upgrade to 10GB, will provide high-speed Internet bandwidth to support IT-enabled services such asBusiness Process Outsourcing (BPO). It will also enhance efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery to the citizens of Uganda through electronic transactions such as e-taxation, e- health and e-learning.Saka said the NBI will improve collaboration within government through services such as unified messaging and support the digital migration process by providingauxiliary infrastructure for the transmission and delivery of digital television signals.The facility will also facilitate business transactions nationally and internationally through the adoption of e-commerce.Government is set to tender outmanagement of the second phase of the project to a private operator who will ensure 24-hour availability of the network.The minister of information and communication technology, Ruhakana Rugunda, said a share of the funds raised by the private manager, who willlease capacity to the private sector, will be used to maintain and develop new routes of the network. In a directive that will likely hit the revenue of private telecom operators, President Yoweri Museveni has directed that all ministries and agencies that are connected on the network should use it as their primary infrastructure for voice, data, Internet and email.Rugunda said that when commercialization of the backbone is finalised, it will be possible to deploy services such as video conferencing, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), unified messaging and collaboration services, which can allow sharing of data across government. 'Other priority interventions to optimize use of the NBI/EGI will include bulk purchase of international Internet bandwidth capacity for priority targeted user groups, establishing a shared ICT services platform (government 'cloud') for hosting all existing and future e- government applications,' Rugunda said.The infrastructure will also help in establishing what he called public key infrastructure to facilitate secure e-transactions, and support BPO or IT-enabled services including incubation and training.Already, five ministries including that of defence and foreign affairs use applications like video conferencing and VoIP.The entire project is funded by a concessional loan from the export/import bank (EXIM) of China. Uganda has to pay back the loan over a period of 20 years.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020111014e7ae0015k","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Uganda","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020111014e7ae0015k&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"13867","China","Substantial Financial Aid (Inactive: vague and related to #2171) ","2004","false","28 June 200404:04 PMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2004 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedLome, Jun 28, 2004 (Ghanaian Chronicle/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --A journey of one thousand miles begins with one step, says the famous Chinese leader Mao Tse Tsung.But it still required several hours of a debilitating jetlag on Chinese Airlines flight for the Vice-President of China Zeng Qinghong to catalyse the fruits of 32 years consistent diplomatic solidarity by the tiny West African State of Togo into deserved economic windfalls.For only one meaningful step at the International Airport on Wednesday in Lome gave the Chinese Vice-President a bird's eye view of the warm legendary traditional African hospitality reserved for him by his Togolese hosts.The Chinese Vice-President was dazed during this 72 hours memorable official visit to Togo which has consistently provided diplomatic support on the African continent, for the concept of one and indivisible China since 1971.But a whirlwind stop over in the northern town of Kara brought Vice-President Zeng face to face with President Eyadema who literarily carried the whole of Togo into the great halls of the magnificent Palace of Congresses in the northern capital of Kara constructed by Chinese architectural ingenuity three decades ago.The Palace today stands as an indelible monument in the bonds of sincerity and warm hearted friendship which have become the bedrock of the diplomatic relations between Togo and China.For several electrifying hours, the Togolese people rolled over an African indigenous red-carpet treatment for the visiting Chinese Vice-President as folkloric groups animatedly competed with explosion of cultural dancers, in a fascinating show of joy, pomp and pageantry.The transfixed, and baffled Chinese Vice-President Zeng Qinghong was caught with the contagion of rich cultural razzmatazz.By the time he was ushered by Togolese State Protocol to be decorated with the Highest State Honour of Grand Officer of the Order of Mono, independent observers unanimously agreed that the eventful visit had served to catalyse the fruits of the long standing diplomatic relations between Togo and China.A subsequent joint communique which preceded a grand state dinner epitomised the throbbing mood of diplomatic excitement which the Kara encounter richly exuded.In the joint communique, both Togo and China provided perspectives for a more expansive but improved platform for bilateral co-operation concretised by the announcement of the establishment of a permanent joint commission.According to the communique, the Joint Sino-Togolese Commission will act as a motor to lubricate the wheels of the five principles of peaceful co-existence on the vital political, economic, and commercial domains.The communique also envisaged a enlarged perspectives for 'deepening the friendly relations between Togo and China using the fulcrum of increased economic and technical co-operation for mutual support at international levels.'The concurrent resonance re-affirmed Togo's attachment to the politics of one single China, and the 'unwavering support to the grand concept of the re-unification of China,' a factor graciously acknowledged by the Chinese government.Such gracious acknowledgement brought the two countries to 'pass a positive verdict on the balance sheet of their long standing economic and commercial co-operation.'Consequently, the two countries have decided to encourage the expansion of agricultural investments, commercial exchange, infrastructural developments and the strengthening of human resources for the support of enterprises, as have been the case, in the past.The Joint Commission, which will help transform the economic commercial and technical forms of co-operation, is expected to open the way for the implementation of Accords already reached in the past.On her part China took the opportunity to promise to sign two Economic, and Technical Agreements, which will lead to the provision of a substantial financial aid as well as the allocation of an economic grant without interest for the financing of projects to be determined by common consent by the two governments.In addition, China has promised to lend the Togo government a preferential financial aid for the completion of the Adjarala Hydroelectric project.Reliable Togolese sources said that the proposed grants in aid are believed to run into billion of CFA Francs.Since 1971, Togo has struck a chord of harmony in its bilateral diplomatic relations with China with its unwavering support for one, indivisible China and the subsequent admission of China to the United Nations.In return, the Peoples Republic of China has lavished generous development projects on the Togolese economic landscape.These include the construction of the magnificent Palace of Congresses, and the Central Hospital of Tomde, all in the Kara capital of northern Togo in the early seventies.In terms of business, the Chinese have established a sugar manufacturing complex at Anie on southern Togo, as well as, a pharmaceutical complex in the Lome Free Processing Zone.Another Chinese Hospital located within the Lome Central Market, fondly referred to as 'Bon Secours' (Good Saviour), serves the health needs of the residents of Lome.Five years ago, the Chinese constructed a modern football stadium complex in Kege, on the outskirts of Lome believed to have cost over 25 billion CFA Francs.Besides, the Chinese are currently engaged in the construction of a modern Presidential Palace complex for the Togo government whose cost is estimated in billions of CFA Francs.M. Seddoh, Chairman of the Togo Chamber of Commerce says that the demand for Chinese products in Togo has reached an all time high.Though trade figures for previous years were not available, he said Togo's trade imports from China recorded 13,5 billion CFA Francs in the year 2003.The Togo Chamber of Commerce has signed a memorandum of intent to establish close co-operation with the Chinese counter-part.Against this background, the standing promise by the visiting vice-President Zeng Qinghong that the Chinese government intends to construct another modern hospital complex in Lome, appears to justify the salutary resonating cheers of exotic Togolese belly dancers, and the galaxy of mesmerising cultural acrobats who turned out in their numbers to welcome their visiting guest.

Both the road and port are readily and economically upgradeable to enable DSO product export.The Forecariah JV Permits are being jointly developed by both CIF and Bellzone. The JV partners have agreed that Bellzone will lead the resource and project development. A development budget has been agreed and early works are underway with detailed planning for the next phase of development well advanced. Current activities include:-- Sourcing, interpreting and analysinginformation and reports of previous studies of the area-- Completion of mapping and surface sampling of the oxide potential-- Completion of a Company geologist's report (see below for details)-- Identification of drilling target areas and developing drilling plans-- Identifying and securing office and administration facilities as well as operational support infrastructure-- Locating the camp facilities for 80 people-- Commencing preliminary studies on road and port upgrades-- Planning magnetic surveys to map the magnetite potential of the permits and to identify the most prospective targets for magnetite drilling to commence.Forecariah Company Geological AssessmentFollowing the creation of the Forecariah iron ore joint venture, work commenced to identify and assess the potential of the prospective targets to host mineable quantities of oxide ore.The results of the investigation and surface sampling identified specific resource targets, confirming the Company's expectations which were derived from a review of historical data that provided the following results:-- At Yomboyeli, sampling of old pits, tunnels and trenches outlined a ridge of iron oxide with a strike length of over 1200m. The oxide mineralisation extends onto the adjacent plains for hundreds of metres either side of the ridge. Historic pits and tunnels indicate that the surface oxides extend to depths in the tens of metres. The surface samples from this area returned assays of 55% to 60% Fe and indicate the potential for a DSO product.-- At Layah, to the north of Yomboyeli, is a vast plain of surface iron oxides known locally as 'cuirass', with sampling returning encouraging grades. The nature of the material and grades suggest it is potentially upgradeable to an exportable product.-- At Santiguiyah, 12 kilometres north of Yomboyeli, clasts of haematite/goethite in loose iron fines in the form of scree, was mapped over several square kilometres. The surface samples and historic trenches indicate high potential for significant iron oxide tonnages across this area. The oxide resources lend themselves to simple open pit mining and screening with no or minimal crushing.-- Iron oxide at Moussayah, near the regional centre of Doto, was mapped over a length of 10 kilometres. The oxide resource produced similar material to that mapped in the Laya area. Sampling at Moussayah was localised due to terrain and vegetation. Further work at Moussayah is expected to reveal the continuity of the oxide resource at this location.-- Outside of these initial areas are further known zones of iron oxide occurrence, historical data also indicates further zones of banded iron formations and magnetite outcrops.Potential Volumes for five Forecariah Prospects (assumes consistent and continuous mineralisation) based on initial Company findingsLength Width Depth In-Situ BD(m) (m) (m) (t/m3)Yomboeli 1,500 1,000 25 2.6(Yaneyah) 1,500 1,000 25 2.4Layah 8,000 4,000 5 2.4Moussayah 8,000 4,000 10 2.4Santiguiyah 13,000 6,000 15 2.4Doto 3,000 2,000 5 2.4*Figures used for the definition of Exploration Targets are based on field observations and historic reports made during the December 2010 field due diligence.

We have moved quickly to put together a team to focus on developing these exciting prospects on an accelerated timetable.The Forecariah team is working to short timeframes and have leveraged our proven systems and process from Kalia.Forecariah provides Bellzone the opportunity to move into production in the first quarter of 2012. This early production and associated cashflow will add significant value to Bellzone and provide a positive impact on the funding strategies for the Kalia Mine.'The mineral resource information disclosed in this announcement has been reviewed by Peter Batten, BAppSc,, member of the Australasian Institute Mining and Metallurgy.

Drilling results and internal estimates indicate that Kalia Prospect has the potential to host more than 10 billion tonnes of magnetite and 2.55 billion tonnes of oxide at surface.Exploration work continues to further define the potential at Kalia I on both the magnetite and oxide at surface.Bellzone is committed to the staged development of the Kalia Iron Project, which includes a 50mtpa iron ore facility, rail and port, with initial production scheduled in 2014. Stage one is planned to bring online 20mtpa direct shipping ore ('DSO') capacity in 2014 and a 10mtpa magnetite concentrator in 2015. Stage two increasing the DSO output to 30mtpa in 2017 and doubling the concentrate capacity to 20mtpa by 2018.Bellzone signed an Infrastructure Accord with the Republic of Guinea giving the Company exclusive rights to the designated port and rail areas for purposes of conducting studies for the development of the infrastructure leading to the signing of a convention and concession. The infrastructure forms a key part of the Guinea Government's infrastructure strategy and will support the development of iron ore, bauxite and other minerals in Guinea through its availability for third party use.On 2 August 2010, Bellzone signed definitive agreements with China International Fund ('CIF'). CIF will finance and develop the rail and port infrastructure and offer afinance package to Bellzone for the development of the Kalia Mine in exchange for the first right to purchase 100% of the off-take of the Kalia Mine at market price.Early works are currently underway at the CIF held Forecariah Iron Permits that lie between 40 and 80kms from the Guinea coast. Bellzone and CIF will jointly develop these permits which are prospective for oxide and magnetite. The oxide has the potential to deliver cash flow from a Direct Shipping Ore project in the short term.Bellzone has competed an intensive mapping and surface sampling programme and has defined highly prospective drilling targets at its Sadeka Nickel/Copper Project and commenced a drilling programme on these targets in Q4 2010.This information is provided by RNSThe company news service from the London Stock ExchangeENDMSCLIFFRLFILVIL [ 31-01-11 0700GMT ]Document RNS0000020110131e71v0002h-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bellzone Mining PLC CIF Strategic Investment and Proposed Fundraising13601 words1 March 201111:42 AMRegulatory News ServiceRNSEnglish(c) 2011...Highlights:-- China International Fund Limited ('CIF') agrees to invest circa.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A rare Chinese tiger brought to South Africa to learn how to hunt has died, dealing a fresh blow to efforts to save the species from extinction. Born in a Chinese zoo, 'Hope' was sent to South Africa as a cub with his mate 'Cathay' in 2003 for a pioneering experiment seen by some as the last chance to preserve the species -- a 'rewilding program' to encourage the animals to hunt on their own.Africa needs fish farms to offset dwindling supplyABUJA (Reuters) - Investment in fish farms in Africa is urgently needed to halt a decline in fish consumption in the continent because natural stocks cannot keep up with population growth, experts said on Monday. Some 200 million Africans rely on fish as a main part of their diet, but the continent is the only region in the world where fish supplies per capita are falling, according to reports prepared for a 'Fish for All' summit in the Nigerian capital.Japan to promote 'Warm Biz' look to save energyTOKYO (Reuters) - Spurred by the success of a 'Cool Biz' campaign this summer that encouraged men to dress down to save energy, Japan plans to continue conservation efforts this fall and winter by promoting 'Warm Biz' fashion. Government workers and politicians, known for conservative fashions, have been encouraged to leave off coats and ties between June 1 and September 30 so that air conditioner thermostats can be set higher to help fight global warming.Haze eases as rain, firefighters douse Indonesia blazesJAKARTA (Reuters) - Heavy rains and an international firefighting effort on Indonesia's Sumatra have extinguished most forest fires that had spewed choking haze over parts of the island and neighboring Malaysia, officials said on Monday. Smoke from the fires on Sumatra island blanketed parts of peninsular Malaysia -- including its capital city, Kuala Lumpur -- in recent weeks, prompting the country to send firefighters to Sumatra last week.Toxic waste sparks violent protest at China factoryBEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese protesters set fire to factory buildings and police cars in a clash sparked by toxic waste, police and residents said on Monday, the latest illustration of a growing wave of public dissent. Saturday's violence at the Tian Neng Battery Co. was also the third protest in the eastern province of Zhejiang in recent months caused by pollution, highlighting the environmental price of China's rise to become the world's seventh-largest economy.Mirant may shut Potomac River plant due to pollutionNEW YORK (Reuters) - Mirant Corp. on Monday said it may shut down its Potomac River generating station in two days unless it can resolve concerns about the air quality in the vicinity of the power plant. The bankrupt power company has already reduced output at the plant's five units to their 'lowest feasible levels' in response to the concerns, according to a statement.Hong Kong finds suspected carcinogen in fish from ChinaHONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's government said on Sunday it had discovered a suspected cancer-causing chemical in some freshwater fish imported from China, but denied the mainland had suspended exports to the territory. The discovery is the latest in a string of health scares to hit Hong Kong, which relies heavily on mainland China for its food supplies.New treatment works against SARS in monkeysWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An experimental treatment approach called RNA interference reduced the severity of SARS infections in monkeys, U.S. researchers reported on Sunday.

The agreement A deal between Chinese and South African companies that includes cooperation on coal-to-oil technology may help reduce China's dependency on crude imports.

It is set to unlock potential resources in the under-explored area and bolster supply for the 3,800-km Xinjiang-Shanghai gas pipeline. The cooperation will be in a profit-sharing structure, foreign firms footing the exploration bill with output and revenues shared after all the expenses are recovered.MACROECONOMICSYuan gains on the dollarThe renminbi closed at 7.9859 to the dollar on July 7, its highest level since being unpegged last year. Down from 7.9925 on July 6, the yuan reached as low as 7.9850 during the day. Although traders expect the Chinese currency to appreciate in the long term, the dollar's weakness against other major currencies may have been a factor in the hike. Economists say an undervalued currency is behind the mainland's excessive liquidity and runaway credit growth.Forex reserves hit US$925bnChina's foreign exchange reserves jumped 5% in two months to US$925 billion, up US$30 billion in May and US$19.9 billion in April. In February, China overtook Japan as the largest holder of foreign exchange in the world. The country's growing trade surplus, which hit US$61.5 billion in the first half of 2006, was likely to push the country's reserves beyond the US$1 trillion mark, state officials said.Money supply curbs kick inYear-on-year growth in the M2 money supply, a broad measure that includes cash in circulation and all deposits, slowed for the first time this year. The M2 supply grew 18.4% cent year-on-year in June, down from 19.1% at the end of May. The slowdown suggests that attempts by the People's Bank of China to curb money supply may be paying off. The central bank's full-year target for M2 money supply growth is 16%. However, new bank loans rose to US$45 billion in June, up from US$26.2 billion in May. This took total loans for the first six months of the year to US$267.5 billion - 85% of the central bank's US$312 billion loan growth target for 2006.More clamps on investmentBeijing upped the ante on its push to slow down growth in fixed-asset investment, announcing restrictions on industrial projects that do not meet policy goals. The State Council has called upon regulatory authorities that approve new projects and the banks that finance them to examine investments closely. Fixed-asset investment grew 30.3% in the first five months of this year over 2005, according to National Bureau of Statistics figures. It accounts for about 40% of China's economic growth.FDI falls by nearly 8%Foreign direct investment (FDI) in China fell 7.86% to US$4.5 billion in May compared to the same month in 2005, according to Ministry of Commerce figures. FDI was up 2.78% for the first five months of the year and hit US$23 billion. The FDI announcement coincided with reports that the State Council plans to set up an interdepartmental committee to investigate large-scale foreign mergers or acquisitions of state-owned enterprises.Document QEDCER0020060824e2810000mChinese Premier Wen returns home after clinching deals in AfricaVY595 words25 June 200603:54 AMAgence France PresseAFPREnglishCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2006 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved.BEIJING, June 25, 2006 (AFP) -Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao returned to Beijing Sunday after clinching a raft of agreements during his seven-nation African tour to shop for resources for his fast-growing Asian country.Wen arrived back in China Sunday morning after concluding his whirl-wind official visits to Egypt, Ghana, the Republic of Congo, Angola, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda, Xinhua news agency reported.Wen's trip -- the third high-level Chinese diplomatic visit to Africa in less than six months -- follows visits earlier this year by Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing and President Hu Jintao, who clinched important oil exploration deals in several states.The tour to the world's poorest continent has aroused concern that Beijing's diplomatic offensive was aimed at countering the United States and sparked criticism that China's hunt for natural resources was in disregard of human rights.Wen rejected those criticisms and stressed that China followed a policy of non-interference in other countries' affairs.Instead, he talked optimistically of a new strategic partnership with Africa which would enhance political equality and mutual trust as well as promoting economic and political ties.'The Chinese government, guided by the principle of sincerity, friendship, equality, mutual benefit and common development, is committed to building a new type of strategic partnership with Africa,' Wen said in South Africa.Trade between China and Africa reached around 40 billion dollars in 2005, a rise of 35 percent from a year earlier and almost four times higher than in 2001.In addition, China has given 5.5 billion dollars in assistance to Africa, sent 16,000 health workers to 43 different countries on the continent and reduced or cancelled the debt of 31 nations over the past 50 years.It has also promised steps to expand economic and trade ties and help Africa by offering zero-tariff treatment for some exports and increased aid and debt relief, while at the same time helping to build infrastructure.In Wen's last stop, Uganda, agreements signed include economic and technical cooperation, energy and infrastructure, mining, textiles, oil exploration and tourism.In Tanzania, Wen signed agreements on technical and economic cooperation, provision of anti-malaria drugs, construction of rural primary schools and institutes to promote agriculture and human health in the east African nation.In addition, China offered to lend money to rehabilitate the Tanzania-Zambia railway which it helped build in the 1990s.In South Africa, the two sides signed agreements to restrict importation of Chinese textiles to protect local industries, as well as boost peaceful nuclear cooperation and a major deal with the country's petroleum giant to explore the possibility of turning coal into oil.China's growing thirst for oil also saw the country enter a joint venture early this year with Angola, Wen's third stop during the tour, which has since become China's top crude oil source, surpassing Saudi Arabia.In exchange, Beijing is funding the construction of a railroad linking the west coast city of Benguela to the mineral-rich area on Angola's eastern border with the Democratic Republic of Congo among other projects.Zhang Xiang, vice president of the China Society of African Studies, a government think tank, said Africa could learn lessons about development from China.'In the past China was poor, but now it's developing very fast... the African countries are increasingly willing to cooperate with China, because they want to find out how China developed so fast,' Zhang said.vy/mtpDocument AFPR000020060625e26p0053d","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Oil","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","South Africa","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=QEDCER0020060824e2810000m&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"16547","China","Sasol to import 2000 artisans","2005","false","In 2006, Naidu says, 'Last year, a contract awarded to a Chinese consortium, CITIC-ARCE, by Steelmaker Ispat Iskor allowed for several hundred Chinese workers to be brought into South Africa to construct Ispat Iskor's plant in northern KwaZulu Natal. There are also indications from Sasol, South Africa's energy company that it would import 2000 qualified artisans mainly from Asia due to domestic shortages in the local economy. Now this has raised questions about what is the responsibility of South African companies towards addressing South Africa's unemployment crisis and skills deficiencies. If they see it is easier to get foreign workers to come in, then there will obviously be a backlash. This is happening not only in South Africa but in other parts of Africa as well.'Naidu believes the Sino-African relationship will strengthen in years to come, although she says Africans need to better study the Chinese market so that Beijing's economic opening to Africa guarantees that everyone wins. The alternative would be a situation resembling colonial times, with Africa continuing to ship inexpensive raw materials to the industrialized world, which in turn would sell the finished products back to the continent. Historically, it's a formula that leads to continuing under-development.Listen to interview with China specialist Sanusha Naidu:http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2006_05/Audio/mp3/Eagle_China_Naidu_One.mp3 [http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2006_05/Audio/mp3/Eagle_China_Naidu_One.mp3]HTS hppb 060509-430455 PBORADocument INDFED0020060509e258000mv","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","South Africa","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=INDFED0020060509e258000mv&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The deal is, however, still subject to negotiations.A team of Chinese, which was in the country to inspect some of the railway infrastructure, has gone back to complete their evaluation.Transport and Communication minister Christopher Mushowe said although the delegation from China was in the country, nothing concrete had been reached as yet.'I went to China early last month to discuss some of the problems our railway sector is facing. The visit was meant to assess and see how we can refurbish our own infrastructure which includes locomotives,' he said.'A Chinese delegation also came and did its own feasibility study on our locomotives. If all goes well we might get some locomotives from them. However, the delegation left for China last week.'Mushowe's comments come in the wake of last week's accident which left 70 people seriously injured when two commuter trains carrying 3 500 passengers collided.The country's railway sector is dogged by problems pertaining to lack of spare parts which have affected the signalling system since most of the equipment is imported.Last year 50 people died when two trains collided in Dete in an accident largely blamed on the poor signalling system between the Bulawayo/Victoria Falls route.Mushowe, however, refused to disclose how much it could cost the country to secure the equipment from China, saying Zimbabwe was also in discussions with other unnamed countries.'We are not only in discussion with the Chinese but with other countries.

The loan will be used to purchase garbage trucks which will be used to collect garbage in order to beautify the City currently littered by garbage.The opposition Chief Whip Kassiano Wadri has however warned the government from purchasing substandard products from China which he says are not durable. Members of parliament called for a comprehensive sanitary policy to tackle the growing sanitary problems in the country. They demanded that parliament lend a hand in helping KCC and other local council authorities across the country to effectively deal with the ever increasing sanitary problems in the City. Private contractors have been handling more than 80 percent of the garbage collection for KCC. This trend is likely to change with the approval of the loan since the City will have capacity to manage its own wastedisposal.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Uganda","http://www.ugpulse.com/uganda-news/government/kampala-to-set-up-a-road-unit/5675.aspx

"19983","China","Chinese medical team in Zimbabwe","2008","false","Chinese Firm Mulls US$500m Investment529 words12 May 200808:57 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2008 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedHarare, May 12, 2008 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- A Chinese company is exploring the possibility of investing US$500 million for electricity generation in Zimbabwe, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Nansheng Yuan has said.Addressing journalists in Harare on Thursday, Ambassador Nasheng said China was ready to assist Zimbabwe in infrastructure restoration.He also said the China Hainan Airline was willing to expand the Victoria Falls Airport.'While Zimbabwe is still in the process of election, China has never stopped its assistance to the Zimbabwean people.'New funds will be injected for the ongoing renovation of the National Sports Stadium,' said Ambassador Yuan.He said a new Chinese medical team arrived in Zimbabwe on Thursday and according to the working protocol between the two countries signed in March, China would make the payment for these doctors.Ambassador Nasheng said under the eight measures of assisting Africa proposed by Chinese President Hu Jintao during the China-Africa Beijing Summit in 2006, China would set up an Agricultural Technology Demonstration Centre, a hospital and two schools in Zimbabwe.He said the investment in ATDC had increased from 10 million RMB to 40 million RMB and both Governments had finalised all the preparations and other related work.'Another team of 10 Chinese Youth volunteers will arrive soon to start from where the previous team has left. Zimbabwe's personnel in the public sector will continue to benefit from short-term training courses offered by China in various fields ranging from computer science to agro-technique,' said Ambassador Yuan.He said the courses were targeted at all African countries while the number of Zimbabweans trained last year was the highest in Africa.He said China was planning to fund an orphanage school, which will accommodate over 800 orphans.On the ship carrying arms to Zimbabwe, Ambassador Nasheng said China upholds the principle of non-interference in other country's internal affairs.He said the relevant sales contract was signed last year and had nothing to do with the elections in Zimbabwe.'Since Zimbabwe cannot receive the goods as scheduled, the Chinese company could not unload and the goods were taken back to China,' he said.The ambassador said China and Zimbabwe had strong bonds of friendship and co-operation that developed since the days of Zimbabwe's struggle for independence.Ambassador Nasheng said these relations were now bearing fruit in many fields of co-operation, including politics, economic co-operation and trade, culture, tourism, people to people contact, especially after Zimbabwe adopted the Look East policy in 2002.'Take trade for example. In 2003, bilateral trade was US$197 million. In 2007, trade reached US$340 million, up 72,6 percent from that in 2003.'Zimbabwe exports to China also increased to US$200 million from US$167 million in 2003, a rise by 20 percent,' he said.He said the aggregate investment by Chinese companies in engineering and contracted projects amounted to US$1,6 billion.Ambassador Nasheng said it was his fervent hope that the good harmonious relations existing between the two countries would continue to grow from strength to strength.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020080512e45c000pb","Health","","","Implementation","2","Free-standing technical assistance","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020080512e45c000pb&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"19684","China","Chinese mining investment [2012 commitment year]","2012","false","Zambia: Muliashi Leading Luanshya to Lost GloryBY GETHSEMANE MWIZABI, 5 APRIL 2012CommentLUANSHYA, as writer Corinna Arndt put it, has known its best times and worst of times but its residents are optimistic that major Chinese investments would bring back the glory days.And it seems the glory days are here again.The town, which boasts of having the oldest mine in Zambia, has great expectations from the new owners of Luanshya Copper Mines (LCM) who have moved to develop the Muliashi Mine project, now ready for commissioning.As Muliashi Mine is now ready for commissioning, there are great expectations from the people of Luanshya, who only two-and-half years ago were in state of helplessness after the unexpected closure of the mine.China Luanshya Mine engaged Gomes Haulage to rehabilitate the road leading to Mulyashi Mine site and other road infrastructure in the area.The new project has 'A' grade copper oxide and has a lifespan of 15 years.Baluba Mine, an adjacent unit also owned by China Non Ferrous Metals Corporation Luanshya Copper Mine has 'B' grade copper.Production has started at a minimal level but once it is fully operational, annual production capacity is expected to reach 41, 000 tonnes of copper cathodes.The leach plant, said to be the biggest in southern Africa, would facilitate the processing of high-grade copper using acid as opposed to smelting.Meanwhile, China Non Ferrous Metals Corporation has invested an additional US$150 million in mining operations in Luanshya to speed up rehabilitation works at Baluba Mine where production has begun.More than 1, 200 pensionable jobs are expected to be created for Zambians when Muliashi is fully operational.Ninety nine per cent works have been done on the $370 million Muliashi Mine project, which has come with it socio-economic benefits to the town of Luanshya.Most youths in Luanshya are happy with the development in their town.'It feels good to get a salary every month. I am saving money for school,' says George Kafula of Mpatamato Township.The 20-year-old school leaver lives with his parents and is one of the privileged youths in Luanshya to have been employed at the new project. Since he is on a pensionable job, his plan is to go to school.He is one of the 800 youths who have been employed by the mine.Many of the youth who have been employed were involved in construction of the Muliashi Mine project through a contracting firm, 15 MCC.Another youth, Chanda Mulenga of Roan Section 2 Township is full of praises for the new investors. He is married with two children and now has a medical scheme at the hospital, something he never imagined before.'I will be able to take my children to school. There is just a whole lot of meaning to me and my colleagues,' says the 36-year-old.After construction of the new project, the youth have undergone orientation to prepare them for life as miners.'We want them to prepare psychologically as they venture into their various works as miners at the plant. We are dealing with safety issues as well,' says Solomon Sakala, the safety training officer at LCM.The training, which takes five days to complete, is being conducted in series for the sake of capturing many people who have been employed by the mine.China Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation Luanshya Copper Mines has shown commitment going by the amount of investment it has put in Luanshya.Muliashi Mine has definitely breathed more life into Luanshya Town.There is no doubt that the mining sector still remains the main driver of the country's economic development.The sector's contribution to Gross Domestic Product stood at 11 per cent in 2009 compared with 8.2 per cent in 2008.Benefits from mining industryThe multiple benefits include contribution to the treasury through various taxes under the income tax provisions, rates paid to local authorities by the mining companies for social infrastructure maintenance and development, job creation by the mining sector and stimulation of local business development in the areas where the mines are located.Further, local communities benefit through corporate social responsibility programmes in areas such as health, education and local business development.The mining sector still remains an anchor to the country's economic development.'As a mine, we are committed to creating employment for local people. There are also many indirect jobs that have been created as a result of Muliashi and the re-opening of Luanshya Copper Mines,' says Sydney Chileya, the spokesperson.With robust investment activities in the town, the glory days are back to what once became known as a 'ghost town'.While the old mining town has lost much of its lustre, it has now been given another chance to thrive.A huge cash injection from the Chinese consortium into the once-flourishing mine has given the locals hope for a better future.The majority of residents in Luanshya, though, are too destitute to escape the vicious cycle of poverty.For them, the past two decades have been nothing short of a roller-coaster ride, with their livelihoods being at the mercy of short-term economic interests of overseas shareholders.The situation is now different as the new mine owners have shown commitment for long-term investment.As a result of the new Muliashi project, a new clinic is being built to cater for the miners in the Muliashi catchment area.A doctor, nurses and general workers would be employed and several youths have been targetted by the mine for training in crafts.The Luanshya Mine Craft School offers refresher courses for artisans to brace themselves with new trends in the mining industry, which is ever evolving.Further, a new market called Zaone has been built and would be commissioned soon, while a bridge near Muliashi area would be built to help small-scale farmers access their markets.During the rainy season the area gets flooded, which is the reason mine has seen it fit to build a bridge to ease the pain of peasant farmers.Zaone Market, a project which cost K600 million kicked off in 2011 after approval of the design by Luanshya Municipal Council.Further, mineral exploration works have started in Lufubu area, located approximately nine kilometres west of Muliashi Mine.The Lufubu project is meant to increase the lifespan of the mine and improve the economy of Luanshya.As for the employed youth, they can now boast of pay cheques at the end of every month, thanks to the ever-increasing investments in the mines.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Tied","4","Zambia","http://allafrica.com/stories/201204050901.html

"21621","China","23 vehicles [duplicate of 1449]","2003","false","Accra, Jan 22, 2003 (Accra Mail/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) - The Minister of Defence and Acting Interior Minister Dr. Kwame Addo-Kufuor yesterday cut the sod for the construction of barracks for the Military and received a donation of twenty-three vehicles from the Chinese Government. The barracks comprising three blocks of twenty-eight units and two blocks of twelve units will accommodate 105 families. They have been financed from an interest-free loan of $4.5 million from the Government of the People's Republic of China to the Ghana Armed Forces and the Police Service. Dr. Addo-Kufuor said Ghana and China continue to enjoy excellent economic, political, social and cultural relations and the mutual benefits from these ties are seen in increased trade between the two countries especially in the manufacturing and technological sectors, thus promoting technical and scientific co-operation. He said the donation of vehicles including four tipper trucks, eight troops carrying vehicles, six double cabin pick-ups and five single cabin pick-ups was made possible with a grant of $482,000, and expressed the hope that they would improve the transport situation in the Ghana Armed Forces. The Chinese Ambassador, Mr. Lu Yongshou, said China attaches importance to the friendly relations and cooperation with Ghana. He said the donation is to support the capacity building of the Ghana Armed Forces and a manifestation of the friendship between China's Armed Forces and the Ghana Armed Forces. Mr. Lu Yongshou said since Dr. Addo-Kufuor assumed office he has added significantly to the high reputation enjoyed by the Ghana Armed Forces. He added that China would continue to support Ghana and promote military, economic and technical co-operation between the two countries. In related development, the United Kingdom government is providing the Ghana government with GBP2 million in support of Ghana's participation in the West African peacekeeping operation in Cote d'Ioire. The funding is to be used to provide logistical and other supplies for the Ghanaian Contingent of the Cote d'Ioire peacekeeping force, dubbed ECOFORCE. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) in respect of the British support was signed at the Ministry of Defence, ON Monday by the Minister for Defence, Dr. Kwame Addo-Kufuor, and the Acting British High Commissioner, Mr. Robin Gwynn. Speaking after the signing, Dr. Addo-Kufuor said Ghana was grateful to the UK government for providing her such resources to support the Ghanaian Contingent. He said he hoped this support would go long way to help maintain lasting peace in Cote d'Ioire. The Defence Minister, who also Acting Minister of the Interior, also requested assistance to enhance the training of the civil police and especially for the Police College. The Acting High Commissioner, expressing the British Government's belief that a peaceful political solution to the Iorian crisis was vital for both Cote d'Ioire and the sub-region, said his government valued Ghana's contribution to resolving the difficult problem, hence her consistent support for Ghana's peacekeeping efforts. Mr. Gwynn hoped that the current peace negotiations in France would provide a framework for a lasting resolution to the problem. by Hannah Asomaning Copyright Accra Mail.

"20457","China","China to build a primary school at Harare, Zimbabwe","2009","false","President Leaves for China-Africa Summitby Mabasa Sasa1179 words9 November 200903:09 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2009 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedHarare, Nov 09, 2009 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- President Mugabe yesterday left for Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to join other Heads of State and Government attending the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation, where the leaders will review progress made in strengthening Sino-Africa ties since the 2006 Beijing Summit.He was seen off at the Harare International Airport by top Government and Chinese officials as well as service chiefs.President Mugabe, who is the Head of State and Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, will today address the opening ceremony.Vice President Mujuru will be the Acting President during President Mugabe's absence.Apart from reviewing the implementation of agreements already reached, Africa and China's political leadership will also chart the course of action for the next three years.Sino-Africa ties are premised on the principle of friendly co-operation to jointly meet the challenges of globalisation and promote mutual development.The idea of having a formal forum through which to explore joint initiatives dates back to 2000 when the first Focac was held in Beijing.Focac is a platform established by the two sides for collective consultation and dialogue within the spirit of South-South co-operation.Africa's ties with China date back to the continent's liberation struggle.Relations between the two have grown in leaps and bounds over the past decade, with Africa appreciative of China's deliberate and stated principle of non-interference in domestic political affairs.This is in marked contrast to the manner in which Western countries have historically sought to undermine Africa through unfair trade arrangements and direct meddling in local politics.At the first Ministerial Conference of Focac leaders present adopted the Beijing Declaration and Programme for China-Africa Co-operation in Economic and Social Development.The conference charted the direction for the development of a new, stable and long-term partnership featuring equality and mutual benefit between China and African countries.At the Beijing Summit and Third Ministerial Conference in 2006, 48 African Heads of State and Government and the Chinese leadership discussed further co-operative measures.Leaders then adopted the 2007-2009 Action Plan, which will be reviewed in Sharm el-Sheikh.Zimbabwe, in particular, has benefited immensely from ties with China.Beijing has extended over US$300 million for Zimbabwe's economic turnaround programmes in addition to US$500 000 to fight last year's cholera outbreak.Construction of China-Zimbabwe Friendship Hospital in Mahusekwa, Mashonaland East province, began on October 30 this year.The hospital covers 6 600 square metres and will have 100 beds when complete.The total investment of the project is about US$10 million.The Chinese recently completed the construction of a school in Bindura, while another one in Harare's environs will be done by the end of this year, with both projects costing US$1,5 million.An 80-hectare agricultural demonstration centre is under construction at Gwebi College and 10 senior Chinese agricultural experts -- who arrived in the country on October 25 -- will assist in grain production, dryland farming, aquaculture, animal disease prevention and control, and irrigation.In 2009, the Chinese government donated US$5 million through the World Food Programme.China, along with Russia, South Africa and others, has also been at the forefront of defending Zimbabwe from the political Western onslaught at the United Nations Security Council in recent years.Recently, China's Ambassador in Harare, Mr Xin Shunkang, said: 'The Chinese side highly appreciates Zimbabwe's firm commitment to the One-China Policy and its support of China's great cause of reunification.'The Chinese government and people value its traditional friendship with Zimbabwe, view Zimbabwe as a trustworthy friend and important partner.'China is ready to work with Zimbabwe to further strengthen the existing friendly relations and co-operation to bring more benefits to our two peoples.'Meanwhile, earlier in the day, President Mugabe capped 300 Bindura University of Science Education graduates who successfully completed degree courses in the university's eighth graduation ceremony.Of the 300 students who graduated from the faculties of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science Education and Faculty of Commerce, 15 were awarded with master's degrees.In his keynote address, BUSE acting Vice Chancellor Mr Cuthbert Katsvanga said the university was striving to create a conducive environment for student empowerment and learning.'The university is committed to offering quality education and be among the first to be accredited by the Zimbabwe Council for Higher Education,' he said.He said the university had completed three computer laboratories and furnished them with 20 brand new state-of-the- art computers each.'We have accomplished wireless Internet connection to enable students and staff to access the Internet from any point on the campus and bought a printing press which is already running.'The printing press will serve to generate income for the institution,' he said, adding the university would print textbooks.The university, he said, had installed ten 5 000-litre water storage tanks and another 10 000-litre tank, which were donated by Unicef, while a borehole was sunk to complement existing boreholes.Mr Katsvanga added that the university valued private public partnerships.'In this respect the university engaged Mr Hanif Ahmed Allana, a philanthropist, who came up with a scholarship for the financially less privileged students,' he said.Mr Allana yesterday also donated a motor vehicle, a motorcycle and four printers to the university.Mr Katsvanga paid tribute to members of the university council including Dr Solomon Guramatunhu, Dr J. Nyika, Mr K. S. Musanhi, whom he said had assisted the university in various ways and set up important support programmes.He applauded the Mashonaland Central Governor and Resident Minister Advocate Martin Dinha for assisting the university especially in terms of networking.Mr Katsvanga told President Mugabe that the university's second five-year strategic plan was now in place and would guide them towards the institution's ambitious projects.He, however, said the university still faced a critical accommodation problems since only 500 can be accommodated by the university's hostels yet the total enrolment stood at 2 000.Members of the staff have been forced to share rooms, a situation that has hampered the university's recruitment efforts.Turning to tuition fees, Mr Katsvanga said most students were battling to raise the money though parents were trying the best to make payments.He praised Government for its cadetship programme saying it had proved useful to disadvantaged students of whom about 450 were beneficiaries at the institution.Mr Katsvanga expressed concern at the brain drain that had affected its science education programmes that had hard hit secondary schools.Many teachers are leaving the profession for greener pastures in the Diaspora.Mr Katsvanga applauded President Mugabe on his educational expansion programme that had made university education available to all Zimbabweans.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020091109e5b90008v-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chinese Envoy Hands Over Two Schools495 words29 September 201106:48 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2011 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedSep 29, 2011 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE Chinese Embassy yesterday handed over two primary schools to the Zimbabwean Government built at a cost of US$1,5 million as part of the bilateral cooperation between the two countries.The two schools, one in Bindura, Mashonaland Central Province and another in Warren Park, Harare, are part of the eight measures announced by Chinese President Hu Jintao at the Forum of China-AfricanCo-operation Beijing Summit aimed at assisting the continent, where Zimbabwe is one of the beneficiaries.China will also build a high school, another primary school, a mini-hydro power station, solar power project, a methane project and drill boreholes as part of the programmes announced by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in 2009.Speaking at the commissioning of Chiwaridzo Primary School in Bindura Vice President Joice Mujuru said there was need to review the school curriculum to incorporate the politics of the country to ensure that pupils appreciated how countries such as China helped Zimbabweduring the liberation struggle.VP Mujuru said China was an all-weather friend, which stood by Zimbabwe in the wake of illegal sanctions imposed by the United States and other Western countries.'Indeed, it was the veto power of China and Russia, that crippled the West's yearning for the sanctions resolution in the United Nations Security Council,' she said.'Our Look East policy, which aims to expand bilateral and trade opportunities, and offer priority toinvestors from the region, is paying dividends.'Government, said VP Mujuru, would want civil servants to get reasonable salaries, but was being hampered by the illegal sanctions.She said Government alone might not be able to meet the demand for education at a pace that is desirable, hence such partnerships as the one that exists with China assist the nation to achieve its aspirations.Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe, Mr Xin Shunking, said Beijing would soon be sending six agricultural experts and also provide medical equipment.'I believe that all the projects can bring more benefit to Zimbabwean people and give impetus to the development of China-Zimbabwe relationships,' said Mr Shunkang, also known locally as Chakanaka Chakanaka.Co-operation in education, he said, was one of the important parts of the two countries' bilateral relations and made positive contributions to the development of the two countries' overall relationship.'China always pays attention to training programmes of human resources in Zimbabwe,' said Mr Shunkang.'These two schools will become new symbols of China-Zimbabwe friendship. They will witness the further progression of our relations.'The two schools were built by Chinese companies Gansu Hualong and Jiangsu Nantong. Mr Shunkang mesmerised the audience when he mixed Shona and English in his speech.The event was also attended by Transport, Communications and Infrastructural Development Minister Nicholas Goche, Education, Sport, Arts and Culture deputy minister Lazarus Dokora, senior government officials and local political and traditional leadership.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020110929e79t000hk---------------------------------------------On April 19, 2007, it was announced that through the China-Africa Cooperation Forum, the Chinese government plans to construct two schools in rural areas of Zimbabwe alongside an agricultural demonstration center. An update from May 12, 2008 Harare, May 12, 2008 Ambassador Nasheng said under the eight measures of assisting Africa proposed by Chinese President Hu Jintao during the China-Africa Beijing Summit in 2006, China would set up an Agricultural Technology Demonstration Centre, a hospital and two schools in Zimbabwe. He said the investment in ATDC had increased from 10 million RMB to 40 million RMB and both Governments had finalised all the preparations and other related work. 'Another team of 10 Chinese Youth volunteers will arrive soon to start from where the previous team has left. Zimbabwe's personnel in the public sector will continue to benefit from short-term training courses offered by China in various fields ranging from computer science to agro-technique,' said Ambassador Yuan. He said the courses were targeted at all African countries while the number of Zimbabweans trained last year was the highest in Africa.","Education","","110","Completion","3","In-kind contribution","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020110929e79t000hk&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The rebuilding public transporter recently acquired 50 buses from FAW, with more orders expected to follow.'We are going to be signing an MOU with FAW with respect to setting up an assembly plant and then conduct a feasibility study to determine the viability of the project,' said Kandengwa.Kandengwa could not be drawn into giving figures, saying the cost of the project would be determined by the feasibility study.This is however, not the first time that investors have explored possibilities of establishing a vehicle assembly plant in Zimbabwe. Pioneer Motor Company, which acts as an intermediary for Swedish bus-makers Scania, stitched up a supply agreement with ZUPCO a few years ago and was considering setting up an assembly plant.However, payment problems resulted in relations souring between the two and the plans have since been put on hold.ZUPCO, whose fleet has been severely depleted owing to poor maintenance levels and lack of recapitalisation, has announced plans to boost its fleet to about 1200 buses, with the Chinese emerging as preferred suppliers in line with the government's 'Look East' policy that has also seen national airline Air Zimbabwe procuring three aircraft from China.Early this year Vice President Joice Mujuru indicated that a joint venture, with the Chinese to set up an assembly plant was being considered.Document AFNWS00020050617e16g000pm","Government and Social Services","","","Completion","3","Unset","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020050617e16g000pm&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"270","China","Debt rescheduling","1967","false","'YAOUNDE, Cameroon: Visiting Premier Zhu Rongji yesterday highlighted the progress made in exploring new areas of economic co-operation with Cameroon. During the meeting with his Cameroon counterpart Peter Mafany Musonge, Zhu said that China has provided assistance within its capacity to Cameroon for this African country's development. Apart from helping Cameroon in infrastructure construction, China has also reduced and cancelled debts owed to it by Cameroon. Official statistics indicate that China has already cancelled 75 per cent of the debts owed to it by Cameroon that have become due. An agreement signed between the two countries yesterday after the prime ministerial meeting has rescheduled a number of debts Cameroon owes to China and allowed the country to defer their repayment. China promised two years ago during the Forum on China-African Co-operation that it will cancel or reduce 10 billion yuan (US$1.2 billion) of debts owed to China by African countries within two years.Inside sources told China Daily that the work is proceeding smoothly, but declined to say how much of the originally set figure has been settled. According to a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Zhu said that the Chinese Government has all along encouraged and supported Chinese enterprises to conduct mutually beneficial co-operation with their counterparts in Cameroon. Zhu also pushed for the tapping of trade potentials, suggesting that Cameroon can import more Chinese products that are not too expensive but are of good quality for a more balanced trade relationship. The trade volume between China and Cameroon reached US$213 million last year, with Chinese imports taking US$180 million of the total. Musonge thanked China for the help it has given Cameroon, saying that his country wishes to further expand co-operation with China in various fields, according to the Chinese spokeswoman. Zhu arrived in Yaounde on Thursday for an official visit before heading for South Africa to attend the World Summit on Sustainable Development today. He also held separate talks with Cameroon President Paul Biya yesterday afternoon local time. The meeting was still going on at press time. (Copyright 2001 by China Daily). '                                 'Since 2000, Beijing has intensified its development agenda in Cameroon in the areas of politics, economy, social and cultural activities. Biya's visit to China from 21st to 25th of September 2003 marked another turning point in Sino-Cameroon co-operation. Not only did the President hold a tete-a-tete at the Great Peoples' Palace, he also held important talks with Prime Minister Wen Diabao and the National Assembly President, Wu Bangguo. Prior to the visit, China on the 23rd of November 2001 cancelled Cameroon's debt to the tune of CFA 17 billion.

"404","China","$26m Loan  for Chad (DUPLICATE)","2007","false","'Copyright 2007, Global Insight Limited. All Rights Reserved.China's Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing is currently on a seven-country tour of sub-Saharan Africa, visiting states that his country could profit from by exploiting minerals or securing future energy supplies. Li, having finished his visit to Equatorial Guinea, met Chad's president Idriss Déby Itno, with whom he discussed security issues and the conflict in Sudan’s Darfur region. Li later signed off on a loan of US$26 million and promised to cancel debts that Chad owed to China. The African country is looking for significant investment in its hydrocarbons sector and in August 2006 decided diplomatically to recognise China over Taiwan (see Chad: 9 August 2006:). Significance: China is responsible for building up Sudan's oil industry from a low level and after this first visit by a senior government minister from the East Asian giant, Chad can also expect huge investment in its oil sector.Because of China's special relationship with Sudan, hostilities between Chad and Sudan should cease permanently. Chad's oil is currently exported by pipeline via Cameroon, but with Chinese funds it is possible that a new pipeline will be constructed and Chad's crude could be exported from Sudan's east coat. Meanwhile, Li's visit to Equatorial Guinea saw his host's bilateral debt to China reduced by US$75 million. Global Insight believes China will take significant acreage in Equatorial Guinea's upcoming licensing round due early this year; the country's oil sector is currently dominated by U.S. firms. When Li completes his seven nation tour he will also have visited Guinea Bissau, Botswana, Eritrea, Central African Republic and Benin.

Last February, a Chinese company and the government of Equatorial Guinea signed an agreement on sharing oil production.Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing on Tuesday wrote off 56 million euros ($75 million) in debt owed by Equatorial Guinea, and promised a grant of 1.9 million euros.He also presided at the official opening of the new headquarters for Equatorial Guinea's state radio and television, built by a private Chinese company with interest-free credits provided by Beijing.Li had arrived in Malabo Monday on the second leg of a seven-nation tour of Africa that includes Benin, Guinea-Bissau, Chad, the Central African Republic, Eritrea and Botswana.China is keen to gain access to Africa's massive raw material reserves to feed the breakneck growth seen in its own economy.

"531","China","Deal to build a mine and dam","2009","false","African nations must stop signing away their natural resources in skewed deals with foreign firms, the African winner of the 2009 'Green Nobel' prize said in an interview.Ona, a wheelchair-bound Gabonese activist, has won the African 2009 Goldman Environmental Prize for a decade of activism to protect the Congo Basin Rainforest, the second largest rainforest in the world. [nLH706097]He exposed a secret $3.5 billion deal between the Gabonese government and a Chinese company to build a mine and dam in and around one of Gabon's national parks. The ensuing outcry forced the government to cut the project concession by 90 percent.'Africa can no longer sign contracts with economic partners to exploit their natural resources like they did in the 1930s,' Ona told Reuters in Gabon's capital Libreville.'Africa doesn't have to be subservient to do business. We have resources and economic partners have money -- it's 50:50. Those who don't want to do business by the terms that we fix should go elsewhere,' he said, before flying to the United States where he will receive his prize on Monday.Gabon is part of the Congo Basin and roughly 75 percent of country is covered in dense tropical rainforest.It is losing over 10,000 hectares of wooded land a year to logging, according to Mongabay, an environmental NGO. The World Wildlife Foundation estimated in 2002 that 70 percent of the forestry activities in Gabon were illegal.In 2002, Gabonese President Omar Bongo designated 10 percent of the country's land as national parks.But in 2006, the government handed a 7,700 square km concession in and around Iindo National Park to the Chinese company CMEC to develop the Belinga Mine. The project included construction of a railway, roads and a dam in the middle of central Africa's most beautiful waterfalls to power the mine.The agreement offered CMEC a 25-year tax break with Gabon receiving 10 percent of the project's profits.HOUSEHOLD NAMEOna, 45, leaked a copy of the agreement, and the strong public reaction drove the government to reduce the mining concession by 90 percent, scrap the tax break, and halt the project until an environmental impact assessment was done.Chinese investment in Africa has burgeoned in recent years, but many of the deals between Chinese companies and African governments are shrouded in secrecy.Ona was denied permission to leave Gabon three times last year and was held by the police in December, charged with possession of anti-government documents -- a charge he denies.Through his campaigning, he has become a household name in Gabon and is one of the most respected civil society leaders.'We appreciate his dedication and his work and especially the ideas that he defends in our country,' said Gaspard Obiang, a pastor in Libreville, speaking in a shopping centre.'Mr Ona can help engage young people to understand that nature is something unique that God has given us,' said Armel El Matcho, a security guard at the shopping centre.The Goldman Prize includes $150,000 in cash, which Ona says he will use to fund projects for forest communities run by his Libreville-based non-governmental organisation Brainforest.'I wasn't born to be rich. I couldn't care less about being rich,' he said. 'You can't imagine the reality of people living around Gabon's national parks. We need to put money into helping these communities regain their dignity.'Ona, wheelchair-bound because of childhood polio, has never shied away from political prosecution for his goals.'Mandela spent decades in jail, but he never stopped the fight to liberate the people of South Africa,' Ona said. 'I'm not Mandela, but I say if you haven't found a cause for which you are ready to die, you haven't found meaning in your life.'

"579","China","Grant duplicate with 576","2004","false","a grant of US$1.2m to the Gabonese government, and an interest-free loan of US$6m. The fact that the Chinese government is likely to be less critical of Gabon's failure to liberalise the political system than Western partners and international financial institutions is an added bonus.Outlook and Implications The ramifications of enhanced Chinese engagement in sub-Saharan Africa are likely to be mixed. Whilst the consistency of China's foreign policy should provide most states with a modicum of continuity in terms of external support, its effects will be uneven. Tariff-free access to Chinese markets will not be to the advantage of all parties: the mixed success of the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has demonstrated that foreign legislation is not enough to stimulate genuine economic reform in African countries, and that - when tied to foreign policy - it can have a deleterious effect on the standards of sovereignty and governance in African regimes (see Africa Regional: 26 February 2003: US Lobbies Hard to Win African Votes on Iraq). For Bongo's government, closer Chinese engagement is nothing but good news. China is already involved in a number of developmental projects, centring around infrastructural developments, new technologies and healthcare. Hu's visit and new commercial deals should further strengthen Bongo's position. However, whilst stability is a thing to be welcomed in an otherwise torrid sub-region, Bongo's manipulation of incumbency and authoritarian control of political resources does not bode well for Gabon's political future. If China's only intention in Central Africa is to prop up particular regimes for long enough to withdraw their oil supplies, Chinese 'engagement' is something to be profoundly wary of. //法新社利伯维尔消息 中国国家主席胡锦涛及加蓬总统邦戈2月2日签署三项双边贸易协定，其中一项的内容是双方合作勘探开采加蓬的石油资源。 　　胡锦涛在加蓬的第二天访问行程中，与邦戈进行了45分钟的闭门会谈。两人在会谈后签署了三项协定。 　　中国外交部发言人孔泉说，第一项协定总值120万美元，内容是两国的经济及技术合作。根据协定，加蓬可得到北京的“无偿援助”。中国将提供加蓬“一笔用来落实多宗计划项目的援助金。项目性质尚未定案。” 　　第二项协定是中国向加蓬提供600万美元免息贷款，以推动已开始进行的双方合作项目。 　　第三项协定由国营中国石油化工股份有限公司（中国石化）与加蓬能源部签署，是“一项协议备忘录，旨在证明双方有意发展石油产品的勘探、开采、提炼及出口等方面活动。” 　　中国经济发展近年一日千里，带动全球石油需求去年急速增长三分之一。 　　中国为应付国内与日俱增的石油需求，石油进口量急升30％，当中一半来自中东，其余来自全球其它地区，包括非洲、东南亚、俄罗斯、哈萨克及南美等。 　　一位接近随胡锦涛出访的中国访问团的消息人士说，该项石油合作协定也包括人员培训及两国技术共享等方面。 　　加蓬总统府发表的声明说，邦戈在2月2日的会谈指加蓬“坚定支持中国统一，中华人民共和国是唯一的合法代表”。 　　胡锦涛邀请邦戈今年访问中国。 　　中国外交界消息人士在胡锦涛自埃及抵达加蓬前说，胡锦涛将在2月2日下午在加蓬国会向整个非洲大陆发表演说。他会在演说中公布北京的非洲新政策。 　　胡锦涛将于2月3日到石油资源同样丰富的阿尔及利亚访问，该国是他今次非洲访问行程的最后一站。 　　另据报道称，法国石油公司－－加蓬道达尔公司及中国石化附属机构中国国际石油化工公司（联合石化）签署一项合约，让加蓬石油首次出口中国。 　　加蓬道达尔公司总裁德格罗特说，根据协议，将每年出口大量石油到中国，但他没透露具体数量。","Government and Social Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Grant (excluding debt forgiveness)","Unset","","Gabon","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020040204e0240003p&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Speaking at the “Prospects of Sino-Egyptian Corporation on Oil,” Abd El Aleem Taha, chairman of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corp, said that Egypt will seek to continue to develop energy projects with China. “The cooperation between Egypt and China is very important,” he said. He placed special emphasis on the importance the relationship held for Egypt’s job market, as well as technology exchanges. Taha expects the countries to work together on exploring and refinery projects, as well as oil rig manufacturing. Egypt’s first oil rig, Mubarak-1, was built earlier this year by an Egyptian-Chinese factor. In July 2005, the Tharwa Petroleum of Egypt and China’s Sinopec created Sinotharwa Drilling Company, an $18 million joint venture providing oil and gas drilling in Egypt and other parts of Africa and the Middle East. Additionally, the two countries have cooperated on Egyptian Petroleum HH Rig Manufacturing Shareholder Company. Earlier last week, Reuters reported that Zhiming Zhao, executive president of Sinopec, said China intends to increase its oil and gas imports from Africa by 10% in the next five to 10 years. Egypt, Equitorial Guinea, the Sudan, and Nigeria were specifically mentioned by Zhao as countries China wanted to continue to work with in importing oil. Currently, China imports roughly 30% of its total oil imports from Africa and has invested approximately $30 billion in the continent’s oil and gas infrastructure. – Frank Nieto Document HFTM000020080417e43o0002w '中萨石油钻井公司举行开工庆典2005-12-27 19:45  文章来源：驻埃及使馆经商处文章类型：原创  内容分类：其它   　　12月26日，中萨石油钻井公司在开罗举行开工庆典仪式。 　　该公司是中国石化新星石油公司（SINOPEC STAR PETROLEUM COMPANY）与埃及石油部下属萨瓦石油公司（THARWA PETROLEUM COMPANY）合资组建的钻井公司，合资公司注册资本1800万美元，双方各投入900万美元，各占50%股份。 　　合资公司的业务范围目前以油气钻井为主，将从钻井向修井、测井、固井、录井等其他领域扩展辐射。公司注册后，由合资公司购买中方公司的两台陆上钻机，并聘请中方技术人员从事钻井作业。 　　目前第一台钻机已经开钻，第二台钻机也即将开钻。 　　埃石油部副部长、中国驻埃及大使吴思科、经商处崔明谟公参等出席了开工庆典仪式。  '","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Egypt","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=HFTM000020080417e43o0002w&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"830","China","Construction of China-Africa Friendship (Duplicate of 829)","2011","false","LILONGWE, Apr. 20, 2011 (IPS/GIN) - Driving through MalawiÆs capital, Lilongwe, it is difficult to miss the imposing building under construction in the city centre. It's the countryÆs first five-star hotel, 90 million dollars worth of well-appointed rooms, a state-of-the-art conference centre and 14 opulent presidential suites.The hotel is being built by the Shanghai Construction Company, a Chinese firm, and is one of numerous projects funded in line with a pledge of 260 million dollars of concessionary loans, grant and aid from China to Malawi to support development, including infrastructure.At a ceremony marking the completion of the main building and conference centre, China's ambassador to Malawi, Pan Hejun, said he expects the whole project will be completed by the end of the year.'This will attract more and more foreign tourists to Malawi and enable Malawi to host international conferences such as the AU Summit,' said Hejun.Chinese construction companies have been busy in Malawi. Parliament now operates from a grand new building which was opened in June 2010. That project cost around 41 million dollars.And this month Ambassador Hejun announced China will assist the Malawi government to construct a university of science and technology in the southern district of Thyolo, which, he said, will be ready in just under two years.'The university, which will accommodate more than 3,000 students with advanced facilities, will be one of the best universities in southeastern Africa, and will make great contributions to the national development of Malawi,' said Hejun.Relations growing steadilyChinese construction companies are also building a secondary school in Thyolo, and a 100-kilometre road between the northern districts of Karonga and Chitipa. The Asian nation has also promised to build a China-Africa Friendship School in Lilongwe, establish solar and biogas pilot projects and set up an agricultural technology demonstration centre.ChinaÆs presence in Malawi has been growing steadily since the two countries established diplomatic ties in December 2007, Malawi abandoning its links to Taiwan after 41 years. A memorandum of understanding covering industry, trade and investment was signed between the two countries in May 2008, committing China to help in increasing the productive capacity of Malawi in tobacco, cotton, mining, forestry, fertiliser production and in processing hides and skins.A 2010 report from MalawiÆs Ministry of Trade indicates that the value of trade between Malawi and China has doubled since 2007, reaching 100 million dollars in 2010, rapid growth, though still dwarfed by trade with South Africa, which accounts for just over 40 percent of Malawi's total trade volume of 3.2 billion dollars.MalawiÆs president, Bingu wa Mutharika, has declared himself satisfied with his government's relations with China. In an April speech at the laying of foundations for the planned university of science and technology, Mutharika said the Chinese projects come with 'no strings attached'.'The PeopleÆs Republic of China has demonstrated that they are good friends of Malawi,' said Mutharika.Some problemsThis year alone, Chinese nationals working in Malawi in construction or as traders have featured in a number of unwelcome headlines. In January, police at the international airport caught Zhang Xiang Quian trying to smuggle 3.5 kilogrammes of ivory bangles, curios and necklaces out of the country. The same day, Jennifer Li was arrested when she attempted to bribe police to release Zhang. The two - who both held senior positions with the Shanghai Construction Company - were fined and deported.In February, the owner of the China Superscope Media Company, Ning Naixing, was apprehended at the airport with 1.5 kilogrammes of ivory. Police assert the ivory in both cases originates from elephants poached in Malawi. The Ministry of Tourism issued a statement on Feb. 11 warning against trafficking of ivory.Chinese traders - who have established a firm foothold in the wholesale and retail sectors in Malawi - have also run afoul of the law. Businesswoman Yani Huang was arrested and fined for violating foreign exchange controls in November 2010, when she tried to leave the country with an undeclared $18,350. A few months earlier, another Chinese national was arrested trying to take $144,000 out of the country.Malawi is experiencing acute shortages of foreign exchange, leading to strict controls on the export of hard currency. This complicates life for Chinese traders who want to repatriate profits made in Malawi.Local traders are also anxious over competition from the new arrivals. 'Some are setting up small-scale businesses and competing with indigenous traders. They are making life difficult for us,' Maddy Gawani, a trader who runs a clothes shop in Lilongwe, told IPS. She said there are big Chinese-owned wholesale shops in LilongweÆs Old Town, a cheap area of the capital city.'Many items in the Chinese shops are cheap but not very durable. A lot of people now shop from the Chinese who bring in many things in bulk. We are not happy as local traders,' said Gawani.Relations between the new traders and their clients are sometimes tense as well. Last year, trader Chen Bo Wet was arrested in the lake district of Mangochi after he allegedly forced a woman he suspected of stealing from his shop to undress in the presence of other customers. Nothing was found on the woman, and he was arrested following complaints.Worst fears unrealisedWhen the memorandum of understanding on trade and investment was signed, local groups feared it would have a negative impact on the country.At the time, Mavuto Bamusi, the network coordinator of the Human Rights Consultative Committee (HRCC), which promotes human rights, including economic rights, in Malawi, said the evidence was that Chinese investment had harmed the interest of poor nationals in some countries.'We know that the Chinese usually bring in their own workers when they invest in poor countries and that they have been accused of dumping cheap goods on such countriesÆ markets. Civil society will be quick to raise an alarm if such malpractices happen here,' Bamusi told IPS.But the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions has been keeping a close eye on the situation. MCTU Secretary General Robert Mkwezalamba told IPS that when they first arrived in the country, Chinese construction companies either paid their Malawian workers below the minimum wage or paid them in kind - in the form of clothing, bicycles, maize flour and sugar. In some cases, workers were not provided with protective gear.'They were paying the Malawi workers just about $13 per month when the countryÆs acceptable minimum wage is $20. Some Chinese factories were locking up the workers [in their workplace] overnight,' said Mkwezalamba.But, he said, companies have responded to the MCTU's objections.'We have been asking them to change and they are accepting our demands,' he told IPS. 'We are also happy that the construction companies are transferring advanced skills to local staff.'

[ID:nnTOE69A066]Gabon, the number No. 2 producer of manganese, is seeking to boost its output of the metal, used in steel and aluminium alloys, as part of a drive to diversify its economy away from dependence on oil and French firms.Zhang Longzhu, vice president of CICMHZ, the local company created to run the M'Bembele operation in Gabon's Moyen-Ogooue province, said that reserves were estimated at 'over 26 million tonnes'.Julien Nkoghe Bekale, Gabon's minister of mines, said 40 billion CFA ($84.71 million) would be invested in the project and production would start at around 800,000 tonnes per year and peak at just over 1 million tonnes for about 25 years.Neither official gave a start-up date for the operation.Gabon's manganese output slumped to around 2.2 million tonnes in 2009 due to falling demand after hitting 3.1 million tonneS.Mining accounts for a small percentage of Gabon's economy, but President Ali Bongo is seeking to boost the sector as his country's oil reserves start winding down.Bongo is also actively seeking investment from firms outside France, the former colonial power that has long-enjoyed a strong influence in the Central African nation.Gabon is due to buy a greater stake in Comilog, another manganese operation Gabon has with Eramet , Eramet said earlier this month.//10月21日，在加蓬总理比约盖.姆巴的主持下，华州矿业工贸有限公司总经理农德连与加蓬矿业部长贝加雷、经贸部长恩冈比亚在总理府共同签署了蒙贝利锰矿开采矿权协议。　　中国驻加蓬大使李福顺、经商参赞胡平、中信大锰矿业公司副总经理张龙珠等出席了隆重的签字仪式。加蓬广播电视一台和媒体报道了签字仪式，并采访了投资公司负责人。　　该矿位于中西部恩乔莱附近，锰矿储量三千多万吨，由宁波矿业投资公司获得勘探权和采矿许可权。2007年11月，宁波矿业与中信大锰矿业公司签署合作开发协议，由后者控股开发经营。目前该矿仍在进行矿山、运输等后期建设，预计年底开始出矿。//据消息透露，日前在加蓬总理比约盖.姆巴的主持下，华州矿业工贸有限公司总经理农德连与加蓬矿业部长贝加雷、经贸部长恩冈比亚在总理府共同签署了蒙贝利锰矿开采矿权协议。　　加蓬矿业部长贝加雷称，中国中信大锰矿业旗下一分公司华州矿业日前表示愿意投资6100万欧元开发位于首都东南部200公里的蒙贝利锰矿。公司计划前两年每年从该矿开采800000-900000吨锰矿，接着在以后的30年内每年开采量增长到1040000吨。　　贝加雷在与华州签订收购协议时表示，该矿需雇佣255位本地居民，另外85名可来自中国，开采出的部分锰矿需在本地加工生产。同时他还透露，华州自接受该锰矿后，大约可从中获利7300万欧元，每年的收益可达900-1200万欧元。目前该矿仍在进行矿山、运输等后期建设，预计年底开始出矿。　　目前该矿仍在进行矿山、运输等后期建设，预计年底开始出矿。　　锰矿与石油及木材是加蓬最重要的资源。法国集团Eramet已经对该国其中一矿山进行了垄断，目前为全球第二大锰生产商。近年来非洲也不断迎来中国商人的投资热潮。中国政府在一篇报告中指出，2009年年底中国向非洲累计投资了93亿美元，预计此势头还将有所增长。","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Gabon","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020101023e6an000a6&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

'I hope I have the chance to get a masters degree in China, majoring in international relations.'Lukaka is one of the first 18 graduates of the university's Confucius Institute for Chinese Studies, which was set up late last year by the governments of China and Kenya to promote cultural exchange between the two countries. With similar departments opening in Zimbabwe and South Africa, the institute is the manifestation of the growing spirit of cooperation between China and Africa.Indeed, since Beijing hailed a new era of South-South cooperation in 2000, the Chinese have been making their presence felt in Africa. Trade has grown by 400 per cent in four years. In boardrooms all over the continent, Chinese executives are striking billion-pound deals for precious raw materials, while in markets and trade centres, Chinese businessmen are selling everything from clothes, shoes and handbags to mattresses, wardrobes and three-piece suites.At the same time, construction firms are changing the face of the continent, building everything from roads, bridges and railways to shopping malls, casinos and golf courses. And in schools and hospitals, Chinese professionals are working alongside their African counterparts in an effort to share knowledge and experience.While African leaders have been rolling out the red carpet for their new friends from the East, the media has reported warnings that the flood of cheap Chinese imports is destroying local industries and that Beijing's courting of rogue regimes is perpetuating corruption and human rights abuses. However, there is another side to the story, the impact of which looks set to affect us all.The fact is that China's economic expansion into Africa is triggering fundamental changes in the patterns of global trade, turning on its head accepted wisdom concerning international development and realigning political allegiances. And few people seem to have noticed. The implications can't be underestimated--not only upon trade, aid and diplomacy among developing nations, but on the economics, politics and security of the world as a whole.'","Education","","110","Pipeline/identification","1","Scholarships/training in the donor country","Unset","","Kenya","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=GEOM000020061223e2c100010&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Bilateral cooperation in the areas of politics, trade and health has since progressed smoothly.Over the years, China has offered assistance to Guinea-Bissau within its capacity and it will actively encourage its strong firms to invest in the African nation and help upgrade bilateral relations to new high, he said.Moreover, Jiang briefed Yala on China's stance on the issue of Taiwan and the follow-up actions after the ministerial-level China-Africa Cooperation Forum was held successfully in the year 2000.Following the forum, China fulfilled its commitment to forgive debt by signing agreements with 31 African countries. China-Africa cooperation in the areas of human resources development, tourism, environmental protection and finance has also been enhanced.And a senior officials meeting was held last month in Ethiopia in preparation for the second ministerial-level cooperation forum to be held next year.President Jiang said he was convinced that, through the joint efforts of both China and African nations, the follow-up actions of the forum will go on moving forward, and the mechanism of the ministerial-level meeting will effectively advance China-Africa relations.President Yala thanked China for its assistance, and said the Chinese people are the sincere, great friends of the people of Guinea-Bissau.Moreover, the president said, although Guinea Bissau had made mistakes in its relations with China, it has finally returned to the correct path and resolutely severed all form of its relations with Taiwan.Yala re-affirmed that it has been the set policy of the Government of Guinea-Bissau to resolutely uphold the one-China policy and to support China's territorial integrity and reunification cause.Guinea-Bissau President Yala said that his country highly values China's experience in its economic growth and hopes to learn from China. He also urged Chinese business people to invest in his country.Following the talks, the two presidents attended a ceremony during which the two governments signed an agreement on bilateral economic and technological cooperation.","Unset","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Guinea-Bissau","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=bbcapp0020021216dycg0099d&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The deals confirmed agreements made at the China-Africa summit in Beijing last November between the Asian powerhouse and the enormous, mineral-rich island. 'The deals cover partial debt cancellation, an agreement on economic and technical cooperation, a preferential loan for the construction of a five-star hotel, and finally a deal for a donation of medicines,' said Misa Irodia, director of bilateral cooperation at the ministry of foreign affairs. The deals were worth a total of nearly $78 million, he told journalists late on Saturday. China was also building an international conference centre, and helping with preparations for the Indian Ocean Games which take place in Madagascar next month, he said. An incipient mining boom on the vast island is set to include nickel, cobalt, bauxite and ilmenite -- a source of titanium dioxide -- in the coming years. Explorers are also looking for oil, gold, coal, chromium, gemstones, and uranium.

"1147","China","Trade Development Zone (Duplicate of 1153)","2007","false","Mauritius hopes China investment will spur economy416 words17 May 200702:20 AMReuters NewsLBAEnglish(c) 2007 Reuters LimitedSHANGHAI, May 17 (Reuters) - The grimy, polluted northern Chinese mining province of Shanxi is a world away from the palm-fringed beaches of Mauritius.But the government of the Indian Ocean island is signing a $500 million deal with Shanxi Tianli Enterprises Ltd. to build a trade development zone that it hopes will help to transform its roughly $6 billion economy. 'It's the biggest single investment that Mauritius has ever known in its history -- $500 million and they're starting this year,' Deputy Prime Minister Rama Sithanen said on Thursday. Sithanen said the five-year project, which is projected to generate 7,500 jobs and $200 million of exports a year, is the sort of foreign investment the government wants to attract as part of a 4 billion euro ($5.41 billion) plan to overhaul the economy over the next decade. Mauritius expects to fund half of the programme domestically -- from private investment or budget outlays -- and half from abroad, primarily from the European Union and international financial institutions including the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AFDB) and France's development agency, he said.Speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the AFDB, Sithanen said commercial borrowing would obviously have to make up any shortfall.But he said he had no timetable for trying to tap the financial markets and wanted to avoid doing so given Mauritius's relatively high debt level as a share of GDP.'The less that we borrow from the market, the better it is in terms of debt sustainability,' said Sithanen, who is also finance and economic planning minister.Mauritius is struggling to overcome what Sithanen called a triple trade shock -- the end of preferential trade deals in its key sugar and textile sectors as well as a spike in the price of oil.Local businessmen have voiced concern about delays and possible backtracking on reforms that Sithanen launched last June to guide Mauritius through European sugar price cuts of 36 percent over four years.But Sithanen cited Shanxi Tianli's choice of Mauritius for its industrial park as evidence that the island, by cutting tax and red tape, was becoming a better place to do business.'It was a beauty contest. We had to compete,' said Sithanen, who will fly to Shanxi after the AFDB meeting to sign the deal.

"1086","China","Missile Related Technical Training (Began 1999) (needs confirmation)","1999","false","21 January 2000The Pentagon last month discovered a new customer for Chinese military technology. Sensitive intelligence revealed China plans to build a hypersonic wind tunnel in Libya as part of Tripoli's program to build missiles. The wind tunnel would be used to design rockets and simulate missile flight. In addition, Chinese officials also arranged for Libyan technicians to travel to China for missile- related training and education.The intelligence report is unwelcome news for Clinton administration policy-makers (and will probably be suppressed within the government as in the past) because it further exposes China's continuing proliferation of missile technology to rogue states. The timing is also bad for the administration's plan to launch a major public relations campaign to win congressional approval of Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization.If the wind tunnel is sold later this year and the technicians are trained, the administration might be forced to impose economic sanctions on Beijing for violating U.S. missile sanctions law.China was last sanctioned in 1993 for selling missile components to Pakistan. The sanctions were lifted after China promised to behave. The latest intelligence on Libyan missile assistance contradicts the promise. The White House in the past played down Chinese help to the Libyan missile program, arguing that the north African state is still years away from having a long-range missile capability. ''Bill GertzTHE WASHINGTON TIMES1076 words13 April 2000The Washington TimesWATI2A1English© 2000 Washington Times Library. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved.China is providing assistance to Libya's long-range missile program and made its latest technology transfer to the North African nation last month, according to U.S. intelligence officials.The director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden, outlined the transfer in a classified report sent March 2 to senior U.S. government officials.Disclosure of the NSA report on the missile cooperation follows announcement Tuesday that the United States and China will resume talks on the spread of weapons of mass destruction and missiles to rogue states. The talks were suspended by Beijing following the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last year.Officials familiar with the NSA report said the missile technology transfer followed other intelligence reports in December that China had agreed to supply Libya with a hypersonic wind tunnel. The wind tunnels will be used for modeling and simulation, key elements of missile development.Officials discussed some aspects of the China-Libya missile trade on the condition of anonymity.Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is expected to be questioned about the China-Libya missile cooperation during an appearance today before the Senate Appropriations Committee, according to congressional aides.According to the intelligence officials, the missile cooperation began in March 1999 between the state-run China Precision Machinery Import-Export Co. and the Libyan government. The deal involves help in developing Libya's long-range Al-Fatah missile program.But Chinese technicians have been linked in intelligence reports to the Al-Fatah missile program as early as June 1998, the officials said.Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said during a speech Feb. 5 in Germany that Libya is seeking long-range missiles. In calling for national missile defenses, Mr. Cohen said, 'Libya has chemical capabilities and is trying to buy long-range missiles.'Rogue states like Libya, Iraq and Iran are not trying to build the missiles for regional conflict, he said.'They want long-range missiles to coerce and threaten us - the North American and European parts of NATO,' Mr. Cohen said.The defense secretary provided no other details.An administration official said he was unaware of the NSA report but noted that 'We'e made it clear we think it is important for China to strengthen its controls over missile-related technology.' A CIA spokeswoman declined to comment.Other defense officials said the missiles sought by the Libyans are North Korea's 600-mile-range No Dong missile system, or possibly the longer-range Taepo Dong missile.The missile buying effort appears to be relatively recent. The CIA's public report on missile threats released in September made no mention of Libya's missile program or its efforts to acquire long- range systems.Intelligence officials said despite numerous sensitive reports on the program few details are known about Libya's long-range missile program. The Chinese technology and assistance may be for the indigenous Al-Fatah missile, which is believed to be in the late stages of development, but which has not been flight tested. The Al Fatah is expected to have a range of about 600 miles.The Chinese assistance also may involve training for Libyan military personnel to operate imported North Korea missiles in the future, or the indigenous Al Fatah.A U.S. spy satellite last year photographed Libyan efforts to enlarge a missile test facility as part of the development program, the officials said.The same day the NSA reported the missile technology transfer China's official Xinhua news agency announced that Beijing had reached an agreement with the Libya government to build a railroad system as part of 'broad railway cooperation.'Some intelligence officials said the rail agreement will provide cover for the secret missile cooperation.Further evidence of Libya missile development efforts surfaced yesterday. Authorities in Switzerland announced arrest of a Taiwanese businessman who was charged with trying to smuggle Scud missile components to Libya.And British authorities intercepted a shipment of missile parts in November that were bound for Libya. The parts appeared to be components for Scud-type missiles and may have originated in North Korea, according to U.S. officials.Swiss police said in 1996 they also intercepted a container from China marked 'machine components' that had come from North Korea and were being shipped illegally to Egypt.Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has said he plans to develop long- range missiles capable of attacking the United States, according to congressional panel on missile threats headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.According to the Rumsfeld Commission report, Col. Gadhafi said of his adversaries in a 1990 speech: 'If they know that you have a deterrent force capable of hitting the United States, they would not be able to hit you. If we had possessed a deterrent - missiles that could reach New York - we would have hit it at the same moment [as the 1986 U.S. air strike on Libya]. Consequently, we should build this force so that they and others will no longer think about an attack.' '' Bill Gertz/Rowan ScarboroughTHE WASHINGTON TIMES1104 words30 June 2000The Washington TimesWATI2A10English© 2000 Washington Times Library. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved.A fresh Pentagon intelligence report exposes China's covert cooperation with Libya in developing long-range missiles.The latest evidence was contained in a top-secret report sent June 9 by National Security Agency Director Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden to top administration officials. The NSA report reveals that the director of Libya's Al-Fatah missile program is planning to travel to China later this month or next, according to intelligence officials who have seen it.The Libyan will go to the University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Beijing, China's premier training center for missile scientists and technicians. That's where China is training Libyan missile specialists.The report is the latest in a series of intelligence reports on the growing cooperation between China and Libya on missile development.We disclosed in this space in January that China is building a hypersonic wind tunnel in Libya for the Al-Fatah missile program, and that Libyan technicians would be sent to China for missile training.The latest report is more bad news for the Clinton White House. National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger had been lobbying furiously to block a bill sponsored by Sen. Fred Thompson, Tennessee Republican. His bill would punish China with sanctions for its ongoing missile and weapons technology sales to rogue states. Mr. Berger insists China's record on dangerous weapons sales is improving. But numerous intelligence reports indicate that's not true.Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright told a Senate hearing in April that the United States formally protested the China-Libya missile cooperation. She commented after the missile sharing was reported by The Washington Times.

"1094","China","Scholarships for Medical Training in China (duplicate with ID: 1093)","2009","false","Migration Calls for Cross-Border Health Policies [interview]by Kristin Palitza956 words31 March 200907:32 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2009 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedMaseru, Mar 31, 2009 (Inter Press Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Kristin Palitza interviews MOTUMI RALEJOE, parliamentarian and member of Lesotho's All Basotho Convention (ABC) party.The mountain kingdom of Lesotho faces a number of unique hurdles with regard to HIV and AIDS.The country is landlocked within South Africa, the epicentre of the pandemic, and because of limited job opportunities and high unemployment rates within Lesotho, many of its citizens work as migrant labourers in neighbouring South Africa.This risk is combined with Lesotho having a particularly weak public health infrastructure due to rural isolation, lack of skilled health workers and high poverty rates.IPS: Lesotho is landlocked within South Africa and as a result has many migrant labourers into South Africa, a country with a high HIV prevalence. What are Lesotho's public health repercussions?Motumi Ralejoe: Migrant labourers, particularly all those working in South African mines, are a huge concern because they pose a high risk of having multiple concurrent partnerships [which increase the risk of spreading the virus] and of taking HIV infections across borders, between Lesotho and South Africa.How are you tackling this issue?We have launched major public information and awareness raising campaigns throughout the country to bring useful information to all our people. We have designed messages that are easily understood and provided in both our languages, Sesotho and English, to reach everyone.In addition, we have launched educational programmes in primary schools and clinics countrywide, with particular focus on reaching the next generation of children and pregnant women.Do you have cross-border health policies with South Africa?The health departments of Lesotho and South Africa have an 'open door' policy and talk from time to time to tackle issues around HIV jointly.I am not aware of specific cross-border health policies between the two countries. We adhere to policies and declarations of the SADC [the Southern African Development Community] region to which both countries belong, for example to the SADC Health Protocol [of 1999].Migration into South Africa and back has led to large numbers of Basotho defaulting from antiretroviral (ARV) and tuberculosis (TB) treatment. How do you prevent increased drug resistance?South Africa often raises health questions first, and we learn about these issues through the media. We, as parliamentarians, pick up on these issues and relay them to our government. For example, when the first cholera outbreaks were reported in South Africa last year, we made sure that our health department is ready to deal with cholera crossing into our borders.With regard to HIV and TB, we try to offer integrated health services, so that a patient who started ARV or TB treatment in South Africa can continue it in Lesotho. In addition, we place emphasis on educating people about the importance of adherence.What programmes do you have in place for treating HIV/TB co-infection?We do offer both HIV and TB testing in most of our public health facilities. Our biggest problem is that clinics have to send all blood samples to district hospitals, which means that it takes about a week to get results. That causes long waiting times for patients and some don't come back for their results.We are trying to speed up HIV testing by making finger prick tests [that don't need to be analysed in a laboratory] available in rural clinics, so that patients can get their test results immediately.A key difficulty in Lesotho is poor public health infrastructure because of rural isolation due to mountainous geography. How are you planning to improve health infrastructure?Lesotho has a Millennium Challenge Account [a bilateral development fund run by the United States government-owned Millennium Challenge Corporation], which includes funding for more than 50 new clinics and to upgrade existing ones. We will start this year and spend more than $1 million over the next five years on health infrastructure.Another key problem in Lesotho is that we have lost large numbers of skilled health workers, doctors and nurses, to South Africa and other countries throughout the world, mainly because of low salaries. We have to invest more money into training of new health workers to fill those gaps, and we need our health department to place emphasis on this.Despite all these hurdles, you managed to decrease HIV prevalence from 31 percent to 23 percent. How did you achieve this?Information and education have played a very important role. We ensure that prevention messages are spread at village level where the sense of community is very strong. As I mentioned before, we also target primary schools with AIDS education to raise an HIV-aware next generation.I believe we could reduce HIV prevalence even more if we also managed to reduce poverty and hunger in Lesotho. If you have access to three meals a day and healthy nutrition, you have a better chance of staying healthier for longer.Lesotho closely cooperates with China on HIV and other health issues. What are the benefits of this partnership? How did it come about?Lesotho and China have been in business for many, many years, with China having moved into the textile business in Lesotho at a large scale. The Lesotho government opened its doors to China, a country with a huge economy that is flexing its muscle in Africa.HIV prevalence in the textile industry is high, so China provides funding for HIV and AIDS care to the Office of the First Lady of the Lesotho government. The Chinese also offer scholarships so that Basotho medical students can study in China, and we have many Chinese doctors practising in Lesotho.Document AFNWS00020090331e53000i3","Health","","","Completion","3","Scholarships/training in the donor country","Unset","","Lesotho","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020090331e53v000i3&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The latest issue is typical: one company has finished a bridge in Angola, another is building an agricultural research centre in Mozambique, and direct investment in the first six months of the year stood at £345m, nearly twice that of the same period last year.The bulletin highlights the pace of China's scramble for Africa, arguably the most important geo-political change since the fall of the Berlin wall. When the Chinese turned to Africa in 1996 to provide the raw materials to fuel their astonishing growth, trade between the two was worth a paltry £3.5bn. Last year it stood at £66bn, with hundreds of Chinese companies operating on the continent. India, South Korea and other Asian countries are following in their wake.The focus is on the resources that should have made Africa rich: oil from Angola, gas from Nigeria, copper from Zambia, cobalt from the Congo. Beijing is even hoping Africa can help feed the growing Chinese population, buying up precious agricultural land and investing in research projects. In Mozambique, for example, China has offered £500m to modernise farming infrastructure, together with financing a canal and sending over more than 100 agricultural experts to help improve crop yields.The Chinese are not just plundering Africa's natural resources. They have built roads, railways, schools and stadiums. Shops are filled with Chinese-made goods; look closely and you will find that even some traditional African fabrics on sale in the markets are made in China. You will also notice a lack of Western goods on sale.With this relationship comes political, diplomatic and strategic power, strengthening China's hand in foreign policy and on international bodies - the 53 nations in Africa comprise more than a quarter of the UN General Assembly.China's policy of ignoring human rights issues has led it into deals with some of the more unsavoury figures on the continent. Many view it as a malign influence, propping up Robert Mugabe and, for a long time, refusing to put pressure on Sudan over Darfur. The loathsome offer to the Guinea junta will underline such fears.There are other problems with the Chinese invasion. Some are minor: visiting Mali three years ago, a new electronic scoreboard in Bamako's football stadium was on display. Unfortunately, it was out of order since the Chinese contractors had returned home and the instructions were in Mandarin.Others are more serious. Cheap Chinese goods are stifling African markets. And many Chinese companies win contracts by paying low wages, bribing officials and ignoring environmental concerns. Some deals insist that the majority of work goes to Chinese companies or that a majority of the workforce is Chinese, hindering development and angering residents who see much-needed jobs go to immigrants. Resentment is growing to such an extent in some areas that politicians have campaigned on anti-Chinese sentiment.For all these justified concerns, however, the Chinese are ultimately benefiting Africa. They are offering vital competition to Western companies and finance for African nations. Their insatiable demand for raw materials has forced prices up, meaning more money flows into the continent. And, most importantly, they are ensuring the rapid development of infrastructure, something that is desperately needed and has been ignored for decades by the West.The West must be wary of hypocrisy, given its own record. In recent weeks we have seen one British company involved in a massive bribery case in Tanzania and another accused of dumping toxic waste in the Iory Coast. And, of course, Western nations are not immune to propping up their own favoured despots.Instead, we should push for greater transparency to eliminate corruption and tighter regulations to protect the environment. But it is little wonder that Paul Kagame, the dynamic President of Rwanda, defended China this week. 'The Chinese bring what Africa needs: investment and money for governments and companies,' he said. 'I would prefer the Western world to invest in Africa rather than handing out development aid.'i.birrell@independent.co.uk","Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","","310","Pipeline/identification","1","Free-standing technical assistance","Unset","","Mozambique","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=IND0000020091015e5af0001m&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

It also comes a fortnight after banks in Kenya started reducing base lending rates, a move that was spearheaded by Barclays Bank that revised its levels to 10 per cent.The Chinese loans will be available to SMEs at interest rates of between seven and nine per cent for periods of three to seven years making it one of cheapest source of financing in the country.Equity also announced a revision of its base lending rates down to 12 per cent and said that those seeking the Chinese funds will borrow at between one and three points lower than the base rate.ChallengesLack of access to affordable credit is recognised as one of the key challenges facing the development of the SME sector in the country, retarding growth, squeezing profitability and limiting its ability to contribute effectively to national development.Mr Mwangi said the SME sector in Kenya faced the challenge of high cost of credit, high bank charges and fees, limiting their potential to contribute to the country's Gross Domestic Product and the attainment of the goals of Vision 2030, Kenya's economic growth blueprint.The China Development Bank has been studying Equity Bank with a view of learning the Equity model of banking and its sustainability for rural China.On its part, Equity Bank has been seeking funding and transfer of low cost housing technology and long-tern funding for SMEs.The China Development Bank is the biggest such institution in the world with over $97 billion in assets, larger than all other world development banks put together.Equity also lends to farmers through Kilimo Biashara at 10 per cent rate of interest and to the youth at 8 per cent interest.Equity Bank's business model has attracted both local and international recognition, with its CEO being invited to address some high global profile gatherings such as the G8 Summit, where heads of the world's richest nations sit to plan the future of the rest.Equity Bank leapt into the big boys club in the banking sector in 2007 by a massive capital injection of Ksh11 billion ($142.8 million) from Helios EB International, a strategic investor that bought a quarter of its shareholding.The former took up a 25 per cent stake in Kenya's fastest growing bank, by acquiring over 90 million new shares, making it the single largest shareholder, and doubled Equity's capitalisation to Ksh22 billion ($285.6 million)International muscleIt was the biggest ever such transaction in Kenya's banking history. Helios' entry brought international muscle to the bank, being the home of respected big-name investors and funds, such as the UK government-owned CDC Group, United States OPIC, Soros Funds Management, and International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector lending arm.

During their talks, both Yang and Seyoum spoke highly of bilateral friendly cooperation. The two sides agreed to make joint efforts to push forward the all-round cooperative partnership between China and Africa in the following areas: First, to maintain the momentum for high-level contacts, enhance mutual political trust and continue mutual support and coordination on key issues. Ethiopia reaffirms its stance to firmly stick to the one-China policy. Second, to explore and expand economic and trade cooperation. The project of China's Oriental Industrial Park, set up in Ethiopia, shall be completed as soon as possible. Ethiopia welcomes Chinese firms to invest in the country and take part in its telecommunications and infrastructure construction projects. Ethiopia will guarantee the safety of Chinese firms and their staff members. Third, to increase personnel and cultural exchanges and cooperation. China encourages personnel exchanges and will help Ethiopia train more professionals. China will send the third batch of youth volunteers to work in Ethiopia. China will fully implement the aid projects involving a hospital, three rural schools and an agricultural technology demonstration centre. Fourth, to strengthen political consultation between the two foreign ministries so as to keep close coordination and cooperation in both regional and international affairs. The two sides also exchanged views on Sudan's Darfur and Somalia issues. Chinese Foreign Minister Yang stressed China follows closely African hotspots, upholding the policy of solving African armed conflicts through peaceful means as dialogue and consultation. Yang said China would continue to work together with the United Nations, the African Union (AU) and African countries concerned to play a constructive role in solving the above issues at an early date and promoting lasting peace, stability and development of African countries concerned and African continent as a whole. Yang and Seyoum signed an agreement on economic and technological cooperation following the talks. They also answered questions from media. Before his talks with Seyoum, Yang also met with Sufian Ahmed, Ethiopia's minister of finance and economic development, and exchanged views on some cooperative projects. Yang and his entourage arrived here Thursday on the last leg of his four-nation African tour, which also took him to South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi.

"1425","China","China Guangdong Nuclear Power for Extract Resources stake in uranium","2012","false","In 2011, a leading Chinese nuclear power company acquired a stake in a Namibian uranium deposit. Chinese state-owned firm CGNPC Uranium Resources Co. took over the mine in a $1.22 billion deal.On Monday, the board of Kalahari Minerals PLC (KAH.LN) said it will recommend that shareholders accept a possible offer from Chinese state-owned firm CGNPC Uranium Resources Co. to take over the miner in a GBP756 million ($1.22 billion) deal.Then Tuesday, Qian Zhimin, deputy director of China's National Energy Administration, said that China's planned construction of dozens of nuclear reactors in the next decade meant that it would overtake the U.S. in terms of uranium use.'It is a question of time. We will not have to wait long for it to be true. It should happen some time before 2030,' he told the China Daily newspaper.The China Nuclear Energy Association said last year that China planned to build more than 60 reactors by 2020, with each requiring 400 tons of uranium to start operating. China already has 13 working civil nuclear reactors with a combined annual capacity of 10.8 gigawatts.Forward planning will allow China's rising demand to be met without causing the price of uranium to surge, NEA's Qian said.'The majority of uranium deals worldwide are done through forward contracts rather than spot transactions, and China has always had a long-term plan for its uranium demand and purchases,' Qian said.China is now drafting plans for uranium purchases for the next decade, he said, declining to elaborate.The country's imports of uranium mushroomed in 2010 to 17,136 tons, up 255% from 2009, as it shipped in the raw material feedstock for its nuclear power plants and reserve stocks from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Namibia, Russia and Australia, data from the government statistics office show.Zhiping Yu, CGNPC-URC's managing director, said Monday his company was 'delighted to have secured the support of the Kalahari board as we believe this highlights both the attractive value of the possible offer and CGNPC-URC's status as an excellent partner for the future development of the Husab Uranium Project.'Kalahari's main asset is its nearly 43% stake in Extract Resources Ltd. (EXT.AU), and its resulting interest in the Australian company's Husab uranium prospect in Namibia, which is one of the world's largest undeveloped reserves of raw uranium.CGNPC-URC's parent, China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holdings Corp., and nuclear power developers China National Nuclear Corp. have signed a string of uranium supply deals in recent months.China Guangdong Nuclear signed a uranium trade contract with Uzbekistan's Navoi Mining   Metallurgy Combine in June 2010, and an agreement with Canada's Cameco Corp. (CCO.T, CCJ) in November last year for the supply of 29 million pounds of uranium concentrate through 2025.CNNC signed an agreement in June with Cameco involving approximately 23 million pounds of uranium concentrate supplies through 2020. It is exploring for uranium in, among others, Mongolia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Zambia. The company is due to ship some 700 tons of uranium a year back to China from 2011 from a mine it controls in Niger, and additional supplies from a mine in Jordan.Qian said that by 2020, nuclear power could be contributing 7%-8% of China's energy needs, which is higher than the official government target of 5%.The National Development Reform Commission, the country's economic planner, said Friday that China's nuclear power output in 2011 would be around 13% higher than last year's. -By Simon Hall, Dow Jones Newswires, +86 10 8400-7755; simon.hall@dowjones.com//Recommends offer worth 243.55 pence/share* Deal boosts China efforts to meet energy needs* Kalahari top shareholder in owner of Husab uranium mine* Kalahari shares up 3 pct, below offer price(Adds details, background)LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Kalahari Minerals, the top shareholder in one of the world's largest uranium projects, has agreed to be taken over by its state-owned Chinese suitor in a cash deal valuing it at 632 million pounds ($991 million).In a purchase that will boost China's efforts to meet its growing energy needs, China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corp (CGNPC) will pay 243.55 pence for each Kalahari share.That represents a premium of around 16 percent on the average closing price for Kalahari shares for the six months prior to March 4, before China announced its intention to bid, but it is below a current share price at around 241.6 pence, indicating a counter-offer is considered unlikely.The company said in November that it was in talks with its Chinese suitor over an offer at the 243.55 price -- below the original offer on the table when the two first began discussing a deal in March, before Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster.In March, the two sides were in talks over a 290 pence per share offer. Efforts to cut that price level to 270 pence after Fukushima were rejected by Britain's Takeover Panel, which demanded a six month interval before a fresh offer was made.After confirming its continuing interest in Kalahari last month, CGNPC had faced a deadline of 1700 GMT on Thursday to either confirm its offer or withdraw.'In the light of the unexpected circumstances in Japan and their impact on uranium equities, the Kalahari directors recognise the altered market dynamic and subsequently view the Offer from CGNPC-URC as attractive,' Mark Hohnen, Kalahari's Executive Chairman said on Thursday.'The Kalahari directors view CGNPC-URC as an excellent partner for the realisation of the full potential of the Husab uranium project to the benefit of all stakeholders.'CGNPC, which has been seeking new sources of uranium supply, said its offer was conditional on shareholders representing at least 50 percent of shares taking up the offer. It already has letters of intent from investors representing 3.9 percent.Kalahari's key asset is a 42.74 percent interest in Extract Resources , the owner of the Husab uranium project in Namibia.Husab is potentially the second-largest uranium mine in the world. Exploration work is continuing on the project, currently the world's fourth-largest uranium-only deposit, with an updated resource estimate due next year.Under Australian rules, CGNPC would be required to make a full takeover offer once it owns more than 20 percent of Extract, but the securities regulator can grant exceptions.Trading in Extract Resources was halted in Australia on Thursday ahead of the CGNPC statement.Rio Tinto holds an 11 percent stake in Kalahari and 14 percent of Extract.Extract and Rio Tinto have been discussing combining the Husab project with Rio Tinto's neighbouring Rossing uranium mine, and analysts see the global miner potentially working with the Chinese in Namibia.Deutsche Bank is adviser to CGNPC, Azure Capital and Ambrian Partners are advising Kalahari, and Rothschild is advising Extract.(Reporting by Clara Ferreira-Marques and Matt Scuffham; Editing by Helen Massy-Beresford)","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Tied","4","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJCFWE0020110308e738009c5&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

It did not say when the money will be disbursed.The loan will help pay for deep well water projects in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa while the fleet of 90 vehicles -- 65 cars and 25 buses -- would be used to 'serve state guests', Xinhua said.Government leaders from both sides said the loan demonstrated good bilateral relations which would improve further with deeper trade and investment links.China's increasing reliance on Africa for oil and mineral resources, as well as diplomatic support, has been backed in recent years by more monetary aid from Beijing.A separate Xinhua report said China handed over to Ethiopia on Wednesday a modern hospital built by Beijing at a cost of 80 million yuan ($12.6 million) to 'promote friendship' between the two states.But critics say China's aid is too often tied to its investment interests and can undermine efforts to encourage clean government in Africa because it does not demand the same kind of accountability as Western aid does.China says its aid comes with no strings attached, is welcomed by African nations and has benefited millions of ordinary people.

"1499","China","Chinese-funded regional hospital in eastern Ghana (duplicate)","2003","false","Roundup - China, Ghana enjoy good economic relations.by Li Tao, Sun Baoyu639 words17 November 2003Xinhua News AgencyXNEWSEnglish(c) Copyright 2003 Xinhua News AgencyACCRA, No. 18 (Xinhua) - Despite the long distance between the two countries, China and Ghana enjoy good economic relations which could date back to the early 1960s.Since 1972 when the two countries resumed their diplomatic relations, the government of China has ever since been providing both technical and financial assistance in the form of loans and grants to support the socio-economic development efforts of Ghana.According to G. D. Apatu, a senior official in the Ghanaian Finance Ministry, China has provided various financial assistance packages to Ghana in the framework of bilateral cooperation, which covers many economic sectors of Ghana, such as health, food and agriculture, education, culture, industry and roads.The National Theater and Dangme East District Hospital are two public sector projects that were funded with the funds from the Chinese government.The ship-shaped National Theater in Accra, capital of Ghana, was built about 10 years ago, and it has been playing an important role in holding different kinds of national activities of the West African country.The 2003 Model Universe competition was held in the National Theater on No. 8, which attracted models of many countries including from China and Ghana to attend.The Chinese government has agreed in principle to rehabilitate the 15,000-sq. meter theater, which is estimated to cost 20 million RMB (about 2.4 million US dollars), said Apatu.Dangme East District Hospital, also funded by the Chinese government, is located in the area of Ada, some 100 km east of Accra. Eery day, 40-50 patients could be treated in the 60-bed hospital and nowadays they don't need to go a long distance to see doctors any more.Currently, the construction of barracks of the military and police in Ghana is underway by a Chinese company, using a grant of 32 million RMB (about 3.9 million dollars) from the Chinese government. The project is expected to be completed next March.Meanwhile, the Chinese government has also agreed to provide an amount of 230 million RMB (about 28 million dollars) to finance the reconstruction of the 17.4-km Ofankor-Nsawam stretch of the Accra-Kumasi Highway. The road is of great importance to the Ghanaians as it links the southern sector to the northern sector of the country.As for the joint venture projects, the Chinese government has agreed to provide loans of some 18 million dollars to help the cooperation companies in Ghana for further development.Meanwhile, as promised in the first ministerial meeting of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum held in China in 2000, the Chinese government on June 17, 2002, canceled part of Ghana's debt to China to the tune of over 100 million RMB.So far, China has become fifth trade partner with Ghana. Ghana exports to China primary and semi-processed products such as cocoa beans and timber while importing manufactured goods, stationary, textiles and chemicals from the Asian country.Citing the good economic relations between China and Ghana, a Ghanaian trade official said recently that the upcoming second ministerial meeting of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum will provide more chances for Ghanaians to develop further cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.    'The Forum will give the Ghanaians good chances to see, totrade and explore market,' he added.   The second ministerial meeting of the China-Africa Cooperation  Forum is expected to be held on Dec. 15-16 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during which ministers from China and 46 forum member countries in Africa will hold discussions over the further cooperation between China and Africa in such fields as agriculture, infrastructures, investment and trade.    The first meeting was held in October 2000 in Beijing, China,to establish a cooperation system between China and Africa forcommon development.

They are also going to help in the construction of some portions of the Accra-Kumasi road.This was disclosed in Accra when China's vice Minister for Foreign Affairs in charge of Africa, H.E Yang Wenchang, held bilateral talks with Ghana's deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Alhaji Mustapha Ali Idris.Hon. Ali Idris expressed satisfaction on the excellent bilateral relations between Ghana and China which was established four decades ago and which has been characterised in recent times by the visits of the vice president, Mr Jinn Jintao, in January 1999.He stated that the minister's visit is an illustration of the continued desire of both countries to strengthen their bonds of friendship.He expressed Ghana's appreciation for China's continued financial and technical assistance in the health, agriculture, education and, more recently, the construction sectors.The Afife Irrigation project, the National Theatre in Accra, construction of new housing units at police and military barracks and Dangbe East district hospital and vocational training school at Dansoman are all examples of Chinese projects from which Ghana has benefited.The deputy minister further expressed gratitude to the Chinese government on the cancellation of debts owed to China arising from loans given to Ghana from 1972 to 1998 and also the agreement in principle to provide financial support for the construction of 17.6 kilometre two-way lane and 40.5 kilometre dual carriage portions of the Accra-Kumasi road within three years.Explaining the NEPAD initiative to the vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, the minister said it is about Ghana's efforts to strengthen peace and security with good governance through NEPAD and efforts by the leaders of the sub-region to achieve a meaningful and sustainable development.He commended China for her contribution to Africa's development and hoped that the establishment of the Sino-Africa conference will offer more opportunities for Africa and China to continue to consult in the interest of concerted action aimed at addressing the wide range of issues of mutual concern and deepening the solidarity which is essential for addressing the common challenges presented by globalisation.The Chinese foreign minister on his part said Ghana is one of the sub-saharan countries to welcome China, with the leaders having a very profound relationship between them.He continued that despite the leadership changes, their relationship is still very cordial in the sense that their assistance to Ghana will not change because it is not directed to a particular government but to the people of Ghana.The foreign minister re-assured that the Chinese government is ready to work with the Kufuor administration since Ghana and China are all developing countries.He supported the NEPAD initiative and the preparedness of his government to join in its implementation. He hinted that a certain amount of money has been given to the Ghana government but the amount was however not known.by Linda AkrasiCopyright Ghanaian Chronicle.

The Foreign Minister made this disclosure at the Chinese Embassy in Congo Town, when he signed for and received a donation of Office Equipment valued at several thousands United States Dollars from the Government and People of China. Responding to journalists' questions as to whether the GOL would be vigilant and not play the usual see-saw game of shifting diplomatic ties between China and Taiwan, Minister Nimely said, despite many appeals by the government of Liberia to international partners to assist with the rehabilitation of the hydro. So far, he said, it is the Chinese government that has come up to assist the Liberian government with the project. Minister Nimely said it is now time for Liberians to focus their attention and look out for what he called 'crucial economic benefits' for their country rather than be looking for what he termed 'the political benefits' just for personal gains. He said Liberians should focus their attention on identifying the priorities of their country than what they can get for themselves, so other countries that would want to assist could do so. According to the Foreign Minister, Liberia has sufficient food and can feed itself, but noted that this is not the case because the nation has no farm-to-market roads to transport food items from one point to another. He then lauded the efforts of the Chinese government for its many assistance to Liberia, stressing that it is good for the nation to have friends who will bring in the technicians to assist with projects on the ground, as the Chinese are doing in other countries. He made specific reference to countries like Ghana, Ethiopia and Nigeria, where according to him, the Chinese have built bridges, railroads among others. During the occasion that was attended by Internal Affairs Minister Dan Morias among other government officials, the Chinese government donated typewriters, raincoats, ribbons and radio sets. The Chinese government also presented to Liberia, 50 units of typewriters, 250 rolls of ribbons, 8 units of radio sets and 300 units of raincoats. Out of the 50 units of typewriters presented to the country, three will be given to each of the 15 counties; 5 will go to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, while five of the 250 rolls of ribbons will be used for each of the type-writers. For the radios, 5 will go to each of the 15 counties as well the Ministry of Internal Affairs, while 20 pieces of the 300 raincoats will go to each of the fifteen counties. Speaking Wednesday when he presented the items, Chinese Ambassador to Liberia, Lin Songtian reiterated his earlier statement that his country would assist Liberia in its reconstruction efforts. Ambassador Songtian said, what Liberia needs is the capacity to build up, stressing that it is his hope that in the days to come, investors from his country would come to Liberia with the focus of assisting Liberians to assist themselves. For his part, Internal Affairs Minister Dan Morias assured the Chinese government and people that the items will be taken to the local government structure of these counties by helicopter. He said no local government structure can function in the absence of equipment and lauded the Chinese government for the gesture. ／／　2008年4月，中非发展基金总裁迟建新率团对利比里亚进行考察访问。访利期间，迟建新一行拜会了利副总统博阿凯，参加了利政府举办的利比里亚投资环境介绍会，先后考察了邦矿、咖啡山水电站和布坎南港口。中非发展基金拟支持中利联公司投资开发邦矿项目，同时也在探讨资助一些其他项目。 ","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Liberia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020050317e13h001xy&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"2001","China","U. of Ghana: Longdistance Education Project Funded by Chinese [review 1882]","2009","false","Legon ICT-Based Distance Education Project Launchedby Roberta Ollenu500 words11 December 200901:05 PMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2009 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedDec 11, 2009 (Public Agenda/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The University Of Ghana, Legon on Tuesday launched an ICT- based distance education project to serve as an e-learning hub for distance education students within and outside Ghana who enroll at the University.Its purpose is to improve the quality of teaching, learning and increase access to the university programmes by transforming existing print-mode distance education programme of the university to an ICT-based version. It is also to develop a suitable and modern ICT (hardware, software, networking) and make learning easier for students of the University.Minister of Education(MOE), Hon. Alex Tettey Enyo, noted that against the backdrop of the fact as many as 40% of students who qualify do not gain admission into the university, it was gratifying that the university was pursuing the ICT-based distance education project to support governments efforts in increasing access and quality in tertiary education.'It is indeed a global challenge to make higher education widely accessible and cost-effective, while maintaining quality in the face of the growing demand,' he addedHon. Tettey-Enyo said that it was government's desire that through the deployment of the ICT in education, the culture and practice of traditional memory-based learning will be transformed into education that stimulates thinking and creativity necessary to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.He explained that developing countries have shown that these technologies have an enormous potential for knowledge dissemination, knowledge acquisition, effective learning and the development of more efficient education services.He said the overall policy goal for integrating ICT into education was to enable graduates from Ghanaian educational institutions, formal and non-formal to confidently and creatively use ICT tools and resources to develop the requisite skills and knowledge needed to be active participants in the global knowledge economy by 2015.He said the MOE was working towards providing a common network platform for an e-education infrastructure which will provide facilities for the internet services to be put in place for the use of all institutions.The Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, H.E Wenzhe YU, disclosed that the Chinese government is supporting the project with a concessional loan of US $8.5 million and that the implementing institution Tsinghua Unispendor Corporation Ltd of Tsinghua University is also from China.He said the project was in line with some of the decisions made by China at the recent Forum on China-Africa in Egypt last month, which included the expansion its training and scholarship programmes to Africa.Ambassador Wenzu YU added that with an enhanced commitment to electronic education, greater and better teaching and learning opportunities would be opened to lift the fortunes of Ghana's educational system to a new and higher pedestal.He urged all Ghanaians to embrace and support the project because it will positively impact on human resource development and for that matter country as whole.Document AFNWS00020091211e5cb001bi清华紫光与加纳大学的远程教育项目正式启动2009-12-09 17:14  文章来源：驻加纳使馆经商参处文章类型：原创  内容分类：新闻十二月八日上午，清华紫光公司利用中国政府优惠买方信贷为加纳大学实施的远程教育项目在加纳大学非洲湿地中心正式启动。加纳教育部部长、加纳大学副校长、我驻加使馆于文哲大使、胡玉杰参赞、清华紫光公司代表以及加纳大学院系主任、来宾和新闻媒体等100多人出席启动仪式。  在启动仪式上，加纳大学副校长、清华紫光公司领导、我驻加大使和加纳教育部长分别致辞，强调远程教育对加纳教育、社会和经济发展的作用，并对加纳大学远程教育项目的启动表示祝贺。加教育部长亚历克斯•特泰•恩尼奥在致辞中代表米尔斯总统和加纳政府对中国政府提供优惠买方信贷支持加纳发展远程教育项目表示感谢。他说，在加纳有资格接受高等教育的人口中，约有40%的人没有进入大学就学。远程教育不仅给他们提供了高等教育的机会，而且能够有效减少在校学生的学习费用。此外，远程教育还能增加大学的经济收入，有效地改善师生比例。他承诺，加纳政府将一如既往地给予远程教育项目更大的支持。  于文哲大使在致辞中说，教育是一个民族发展进步的基础。他援引米尔斯总统的讲话“接受优质教育是所有人的权利，而不是个别人的特权”，表示远程教育将有助于实现加纳高等教育的发展目标。于大使回顾了中加建交50多年来的传统友谊，简要介绍了中非合作论坛北京峰会以来中加合作成就，包括正在加纳大学工作的我国青年志愿者。于大使称，在上月举行的中非合作论坛第四次部长级会议上，中国政府决定进一步增加对非洲国家的援外培训项目，该决定将有助于加强加纳政府能力建设，进一步增进两国人民之间的了解。","Education","Long-Distance Education Program","110","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Ghana","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020091211e5cb001bi&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"1699","China","Medical and agricultural cooperation restored (Duplicate of 1615, 1759...)","2006","false","DAKAR, Jan 12 (Reuters) - China's foreign minister visited Senegal on Thursday, cementing recently restored ties as part of a tour of six African countries aimed at increasing Beijing's diplomatic and economic clout on the continent.Senegal, the latest African nation to be wooed by China, resumed diplomatic relations in October after a 10-year break by switching allegiance from Taiwan to the mainland.Li Zhaoxing, the first high-level Chinese visitor to Senegal since the rapprochement, signed a 30 million yuan ($3.72 million) donation with his Senegalese counterpart Cheikh Tidiane Gadio.China also gave $200,000 for flood victims after the West African state's worst rains in decades damaged thousands of homes in September, forcing many to sleep on the streets of the capital Dakar.'China will remain a loyal friend to Senegal,' Li told reporters.His tour comes as Beijing tries to convert diplomatic goodwill in Africa into concrete trade and investment agreements. Li leaves Senegal on Friday to visit Mali, Liberia and major oil producers Nigeria and Libya.China already gets a third of its oil from Africa and is seeking to secure new supplies of energy and raw materials to fuel its fast-growing economy.Last week, China's top offshore oil producer, CNOOC Ltd., agreed to pay $2.3 billion for a stake in a Nigerian oil and gas field, its largest ever overseas acquisition.Li said he did not plan to sign any fresh energy deals during his trip but he stressed the sector's importance for China's relations with Africa.'My main purpose is to enhance understanding, mutual trust and to accelerate, further encourage, mutually beneficial cooperation in all possible fields,' he told reporters. 'Energy is part and parcel of overall cooperation with so many African countries.''A BIG DAY'Senegal's Gadio said China had cancelled $20 million in debt and would finance cultural and sporting projects in the African country. Medical and agricultural cooperation would also be restored, he added.'This is a big day for relations between China and Senegal,' Gadio told reporters.Li's Africa tour began in Cape Verde on Wednesday, where he signed a cooperation accord, including a 2 million euro interest-free loan for medical projects, the local Inforpress news agency reported.Negotiations were also opened on other Chinese investment projects to construct a national sports stadium, a dam, and ceramic and fisheries facilities on the arid archipelago off Africa's west coast, Inforpress said.China has steadily built up its influence in the world's poorest continent since the 1960s and 1970s when it offered its support to newly independent African states and threw its weight behind independence movements.Beijing says it offers economic aid and cooperation 'without strings', in contrast to Western states which demand pledges from poor African countries to fight corruption and improve human rights.Critics say the Chinese approach undermines international efforts to introduce good governance reforms in Africa.  新华网北京１月５日电（记者孙侠）外交部发言人秦刚５日在这里宣布，外交部长李肇星将于１１日至１９日对佛得角共和国、塞内加尔共和国、马里共和国、利比里亚共和国、尼日利亚联邦共和国和大阿拉伯利比亚人民社会主义民众国六国进行正式访问。    秦刚强调，中国和非洲的传统友谊是建立在相互尊重主权和领土完整基础之上的。在发展中非互利合作方面，中方一直持积极态度。     秦刚说，中国愿意同非洲国家通过双边渠道以及中非合作论坛这一多边平台来深化在各领域的合作，包括在能源领域的合作。这符合双方利益，也有利于促进非洲国家的共同发展。     秦刚指出，尊重中国的主权和领土完整，承认一个中国原则是中国和世界上所有国家建立外交关系的一个重要政治前提。中国和非洲国家正是在这一基础之上发展了传统的友好合作关系。     中非关系的发展、友好合作关系的深化符合当今时代“求和平、促合作、谋发展”的潮流，相信中非传统友好合作关系还会在一个中国原则基础上不断深入发展，这是大势所趋，秦刚说。     李肇星是应佛得角外交、合作和侨务部长维克托·博尔热斯、塞内加尔外交国务部长蒂迪亚内·加迪奥、马里外交和国际合作部长莫克塔·瓦内、利比里亚全国过渡政府外交部长托马斯·尼梅利、尼日利亚外交部长奥卢耶米·阿德尼吉以及利比亚对外联络和国际合作总人民委员会秘书阿卜杜勒－拉赫曼·穆罕默德·沙勒加姆的邀请对上述六国进行访问的。（完）","Multisector","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Senegal","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060112e21c00213&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"1701","China","Two 125 MW turbines from China Metallurgical Group (Duplicate of 244)","2006","false","The China Metallurgical Group last week penned an agreement with the Senegalese government to build a power plant equipped with two turbines generating 125 MW apiece. In return, the Chinese group will be offered special access to iron ore mined in Senegal by state-owned Societe des Mines de Fer du Senegal Oriental (Miferso). China Metallurgical has a similar arrangement in next-door Mauritania where it is building a new airport at Nouakchott. The deal with China Metallurgical came as Senegal found itself confronted with an ever-increasing number of power cuts and growing difficulty in finding fuel for its power plants. The government has been at odds for months with Societe Africane de Raffinage, operated by Total, which is demanding payment for past deliveries and refuses to supply the country’s power plants until Dakar agrees to pay its debt.Last year the government signed an accord to buy electricity from Kounoune Power, a company set up by Matelec, an affiliate of Lebanon’s Doumet group, and Mitsubishi Equipment. With funding from the World Bank and the International Finance Corp., the two firms are going to construct a 67 MW private power plant at Kounoune. However, relief for the hard-pressed power sector won’t be immediate because the station will be commissioned only next year. Senegal’s agreement with China Metallurgical put the seal to Dakar’s switch in allegiance between Taiwan and Beijing. Senegal had long been Taipei’s leading ally in Africa but decided last August to turn its back on Taiwan and instead recognize mainland China.

The plan had the US ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, and the minister of health, Prof. Eyitayo Lambo, as national coordinators while the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Defence, National Institutes of Health and the Public Affairs Section of the United States Embassy are the coordinating partners.Earlier, Yuan disclosed that there were 200,000 distributors of Tianshi products in the country, while efforts were being expedited to increase the number to 500,000 by next year.He said the Tianshi International Convention would come up next year in Malaysia with globally renowned pharmaceutical companies and political leaders in attendance.But he said that 16 BMW cars had already been earmarked to be given to reward loyal distributors of Tianshi products all over the country.Source: The Guardian web site, Lagos, in English 30 No 04 '","Health","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Free-standing technical assistance","Unset","","Nigeria","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020041130e0bu00335&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.ACCRA, Ghana (AP) - China's premier on Sunday committed to lend about US$66 million (euro52 million) to Ghana to fund a telecommunications upgrades and other projects in the west African nation.China, the world's fastest growing economy and most populous nation, has spent the last few decades building relationships and trade throughout Africa -- regularly conducting state visits and financing infrastructure projects in resource-rich markets that the West has been slower to embrace for reasons ranging from small profit margins to bureaucratic hurdles.Premier Wen Jiabao and Ghanian President John Kufuor agreed to a low-interest loan of about US$66 million (euro52 million) for a number of projects, including a plan to upgrade Ghana's communications network by increasing phone lines and improving the country's Internet-access. The plan also includes training students and workers in communications technology, finance minister Kwadwo Baah-Wiredu said after the meeting.'This will help a great deal to expand employment opportunities in Ghana,' Baah-Wiredu said. 'And we are very grateful to the Chinese.'Baah-Wiredu noted that Ghana has backed Beijing's 'one-China' policy and refused to recognize Taiwan as an independent country.The money is also going toward programs to send Chinese doctors and medical workers to Ghana.Ghana also agreed to help facilitate a loan from a private communication company in China to expand facilities for Ghana Telecom, part of growing business ties between the countries. Trade between Ghana and China totaled US$769 million in 2005, up from US$76 million 10 years earlier, according to Chinese state media. Ghana has had diplomatic relations with China since 1960.Wen is on a tour of seven African nations that started in Egypt and will also take him to Republic of Congo, Angola, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. He is expected to sign energy agreements with some countries, though China has not provided more details on what these will entail. Ghana's Baah-Wiredu said a dam funding project that some had expected to see signed by Wen and Kufuor Sunday will not be considered until November to allow technical details to be worked out.Wen leaves Ghana on Monday for Republic of Congo.7Document APRS000020060618e26i002nx","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Telecommunications","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Ghana","

The Agreement financed through the Chinese Trust Fund is aimed at contributing to the implementation of the National Programme for Food Security (NPFS) through its support to ongoing initiatives and projects in Liberia over a two-year period. On the basis of the expressed needs and objectives discussed with China, Liberia will receive technical assistance from 24 cooperants from the China, including five experts and 19 technicians.According to a Foreign Ministry release, Liberia's Ambassador Ad-Hoc to Italy, His Excellency Dr. Mohammed Sheriff signed on behalf of the Government of Liberia, while the Deputy Permanent Representative of China and Permanent Representative of China to the FAO, His Excellency Mr. Handi Guo signed for the People's Republic of China. The FAO Assistant Director-General, Mr. Thomas Laurent signed on behalf of his organization. The signing ceremony took place at the FAO Headquarters in Rome, Italy recently.Speaking during the brief ceremony, Liberia's Ambassador to Italy, Dr. Sheriff thanked the Chinese Government and the FAO for the assistance especially at a time the country is embarking on its reconstruction drive in line with its Poverty Reduction Strategy.Ambassador Sheriff highlighted President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's drive towards empowering the people of Liberia to invest in agriculture, the bedrock of any nation. He said the assistance is timely and will go a long way contributing to whatever government has already begun in the sector.For his part, Deputy Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China and Permanent Representative of China to the FAO, His Excellency Mr. Handi Guo pledged his country's support to Liberia in its development efforts. He said his country will not leave Liberia alone as it is a true partner and friend to China.FAO Assistant Director-General, Mr. Thomas Laurent promised to continue to partnership with Liberia. He said Liberia has become one of the strongest progressive countries in the West African sub-region and the FAO will continue to help Liberia in its reconstruction efforts.The SSC programmes aim to enhance solidarity among developing countries, allowing recipient countries to benefit from the experience of more advanced developing countries.The initiative was launched by FAO in 1996 within the framework of the Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS) and later extended to National and Regional Programmes for Food Security.Based on the specific development needs and the potential of the host countries, experts and technicians from the cooperating countries provide technical assistance to farming communities for a period of two to three years.Oer the last few years, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Food Programme (WFP), and other UN agencies and development partners have supported the development of the National Food Security and Nutrition Strategy (NFSNS) in Liberia.Under this national strategy, the Ministry of Agriculture subsequently established the Operation Eliminate Hunger (OpEH) to implement the agriculture components of the NPFS. In March 2008, the OpEH received initial support from FAO under the project -'Post emergency accelerated capacity building for Liberia's national food security programme Operation Eliminate Hunger 'Pulukpeh', and acted as the umbrella for the overall programme to further ensure support from donors to the NPFS.In January 2008, the Global Trust Fund for Food Security supported by the Government of Italy committed a total of US$2.2 million to assist smallholder farmers in Liberia to improve their livelihood skills, overcome production constraints and organize themselves to take advantage of market opportunities. The project was approved in February 2008 and is now operational.In line with this Agreement, between April-May 2010, a joint FAO/Government of China SSC formulation mission came to Liberia, to prepare the SSC programme and develop a draft of the Tripartite Agreement defining the respective responsibilities of China, Liberia and FAO.Project sites already earmarked in this Agreement are the Ministry of Agriculture; Songhai Center, Bensonville Youth Training Center; Tumutu Land Mine Action Training Center; Clay Fish Hatchery and Farmer Resource Center; and the Measuegoon Comprehensive Community Pilot Project.

"1904","China","Tanzania-Zambia Railways Authority negotiating with China for $39-million loan (Duplicate of 845)","2009","false","Tanzania-Zambia Railways Authority negotiating with China for $39-million loan692 words9 July 200908:53 AMBBC Monitoring AfricaBBCAPEnglish(c) 2009 The British Broadcasting Corporation. All Rights Reserved. No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation. Text of report by Zambian privately-owned daily newspaper The Post website on 9 July Tanzania Zambia Railways Authority (TAZARA) is in negotiations with the Chinese government for a US $39 million loan to help revamp the operations of the Uhuru railway line. Last Wednesday, TAZARA clocked 33 years of service having commenced operations on July 1, 1976. According to the 2009/2010 budget presented to the Tanzanian Parliament last week, the Minister for Infrastructure Development Dr Shukuru Kawambwa said the loan would be signed during the 2009/2010 fiscal year. Dr Kawambwa said planned capital injection from China would help to revamp the railway jointly owned by Zambia and Tanzania. He said China had also agreed to continue offering tools and technical help to TAZARA. 'A soft loan agreement of about US $39.3 million from the government of China will be signed during the 2009/10 fiscal year... this loan will be used to improve the company's engines, wagons and rollers and develop workers' skills,' Dr Kawambwa said. TAZARA currently has a US $100 million (K500 billion) debt which is costing about K4 billion every month to liquidate as the railway line strives to become debt-free by 2012. Acting managing director Henry Chipewo said in spite of the debts that TAZARA did contract over the years, the position could be liquidated if the railway line could hit 1.2 to two million tonnes per annum of traffic. Earlier this year, Tanzania and Zambia said they planned to concession the bilaterally-owned railway line but past efforts to privatize it had collapsed. 'Discussions with various financial institutions and investors into concessioning TAZARA to improve its services are still going on,' said Dr Kawambwa. And Chipewo recently objected to attempts to concession the railway line to the Chinese, arguing that it needed efficient and focused management for it to remain afloat. Chipewo said the Chinese should continue to support TAZARA without concessioning it to them. 'The Chinese have been supporting TAZARA through the protocols and to them they feel it is the best they can do to give TAZARA the locomotives, the wagons. The technical assistance that the Chinese are giving is more than enough. All we need in TAZARA is efficient management with a focus and vision and inculcate the culture of responsibility in the employees,' said Chipewo. 'The issues of concessioning came about because TAZARA had actually stopped running. So, the only alternative was to look for a concessionaire. But in a situation where the Zambians are able to do that and they are supported, to me I don't buy the concept of concessioning. One thing is true; there is no concessioning that has been successful in Africa or the world over. It is just that in Africa, we don't understand transport, later on, railways.' And deputy managing director Damas Ndumbaro said TAZARA had embarked on an ambitious programme to boost its haulage capacity to tap into freight cargo destined for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia. Ndumbaro said the railway network hoped to capture freights landing at the Dar es Salaam Port for haulage to the landlocked countries in partnership with the Tanzania Ports Authority and Ticts. 'When Tazara took off, it had a total of 100 locomotives, but currently there are only 22 locomotives. We intend to boost our capacity by repairing the defective ones,' Ndumbaro said. 'The strategic plan for the entity includes reviing six defective locomotives, at least one each year at the cost of US $4.8 million.' Official statistics indicate that currently, the flow of goods from the port to inland destinations was done mainly by trucks, which caters for over 93 per cent of cargo while the remaining seven per cent is done by rail. One train has the capacity to haul an equivalent of 60 truck load. The entity rakes in an average of US $3 million per month, which is adequate to pay both workers salaries and fund Tazara development programmes.

Frw22bn).'The construction begins in January next year and will take two years for the hotel to be fully finished,' said Billy Y.T Cheung, the Chief Executive Officer of African Star Limited, a subsidiary of New Century Development.According to Cheung, the hotel, which will have over 200 luxury rooms, is the first investment the company, which mainly deals in real estate development, is sinking on the African continent.'We chose to invest in Rwanda before any other African country because of, among others, the political stability this is what investors look for in the first place,' said Cheung at a press briefing that took place at Kigali Serena Hotel yesterday.He added that the political will and the reception given to investors was another factor that attracted them to Rwanda.'It is amazing that it only took us a day to have our company registered here,' he said, adding, 'We went to different countries including Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania for a survey but we chose to start our investment from Rwanda.'According to Cheung, upon completion, the hotel will be opened to a hotel management company to run it and that they have already bought the land where the hotel and a commercial complex will be built.The commercial complex that will have a conference centre and a 20-story office building, will be realized in what Cheung said will be the second phase of the project.He estimated the complex which will be built just next to the hotel to cost between $30 and 40 million.Cheung added that they are envisaging more investments in Rwanda especially in the manufacturing industry.'Since we deal mainly in construction, we are looking at possibilities of tapping into this industry especially by manufacturing construction materials that will be supplied throughout the East African region,' he said.He further said that he was optimistic that many Chinese companies will come to Rwanda in the future, attributing it to the investment atmosphere that is championed by President Paul Kagame.New Century Development deals in real estate development and manufacturing and they have different investments in Asian countries that include Hong Kong, China, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Technical experts from our two countries will consult on this,' he said.President Mwanawasa said the Zambian Government had signed a letter of intent with Sinohydro Corporation, among other companies who are interested in investing in the energy sector, especially in the hydro power plant projects in Kafue Gorge Lower for 600 megawatts and in the Itezhi Tezhi for 180 megawatts.Another agreement was signed with the municipal people's government of Quindao on the establishment of the Mulungushi industrial park as a joint venture project.Quimdao Kailan group of companies also signed an agreement for the establishment of a chemical fertiliser and pesticides project at a cost of US$ 10 million with an expected production of 200,000 tonnes and 10,000 tonnes, respectively.Meanwhile, President Mwanawasa says he has not yet received a report on the revocation of title deeds from Minister of Lands Judith Kapijimpanga and Copperbelt Minister Webby Chipili by the lands tribunal.Responding to a query, Mr Mwanawasa said he was yet to be briefed on the matter before he could make a decision.The lands tribunal in its ruling on Monday revoked titles for a commercial plot jointly owned by the duo through their companies Pineland Investment and WC Engineering.The two ministers have since indicated that they would be appealing to the Supreme Court against the decision of the tribunal, which was chaired by Mr Sebastian Zulu.

"2025","China","Sao Tome & Principe and Nigeria Sign Deal with Sinopec (Duplicate with 107)","2006","true","23 March 2006Global Insight Daily Analysis WDAN English Copyright 2006, Global Insight Limited. All Rights Reserved. Sao Tome   Principe and Nigeria have signed a deal with China's Sinopec for Block 2 in the Gulf of Guinea Joint Development Zone (JDZ). The signing follows a number of disputes over the awards process for the country's second tender, which has seen some investors pull out, including Pioneer, which was originally awarded the rights to Block 2 (see Sao Tome   Principe: 9 February 2006: Pioneer Withdraws from Two JDZ Exploration Blocks). Under the conditions of the Joint Development Treaty signed in 2002, Sao Tome   Principe will receive only 40% of monies from the oil and gas exploration, while Nigeria, already Africa's largest oil-exporting country, will receive 60% (see Africa Regional: Sinopec Set to Pick Up Pioneer's Block 2 Stake in the JDZ). In December 2005, the Sao Tome judiciary said that there were serious flaws in the allocation of offshore blocks 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the JDZ, but the country has still gone ahead with awards (see Africa Regional: 15 March 2006:Sao Tome Gives In; Signs JDZ Deals for Blocks 3 and 4). Significance: Despite its reservations about the actual awards process, Sao Tome   Principe will hope this deal and the signature bonus of US$71 million is the first of many to bring huge revenues to the tiny islands. With Chevron due to disclose results of its exploration in Block 1 shortly, there is keen anticipation about prospects in the deepwater Gulf of Guinea areas surrounding the islands. For Sinopec, the JDZ awards have offered an easy way into prospective Gulf of Guinea acreage, with more risk-averse investors, like Pioneer and Noble Energy, pulling out because of problems with the awards process, terms and partners.  12 March 2007 08:15 AMReuters News LBA English (c) 2007 Reuters Limited SAO TOME, March 12 (Reuters) - China's Sinopec Corp and Canada's Addax Petroleum Corp will spend $73.8 million on prospecting in two blocks of a Joint Development Zone of Sao Tome and Nigeria, a spokesman said. Jeff Schrull, a spokesman for the exploration venture, was speaking in Sao Tome at the weekend at a ceremony to sign a contract with with Indian deepwater specialist services group Aban Offshore Limited . Addax said last week it had agreed with Aban to start drilling operations as early as the second quarter of 2008. Aban said separately the contract was worth $123 million. Sinopec heads a consortium that paid a $71 million signature bonus last March for a production sharing agreement for block 2 in the Joint Development Zone. Addax holds a stake in block 4. The Joint Development Zone was created under a deal to end a long-running dispute between Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and top oil producer, and the tiny Atlantic archipelago of Sao Tome and Principe, which currently produces no oil. Nigeria owns a 60 percent stake in the zone with 40 percent belonging to Sao Tome, most of whose 170,000 people live on less than $1 a day and hope crude oil could drag them out poverty. U.S. major Chevron Corp. raised hopes last May when it announced it had found oil and gas in block of the Joint Development Zone, but it is still too early to say whether the reserves are commercially viable. Under the treaty governing the zone, even if viable reserves are found, Nigeria and Sao Tome only start to benefit after the firms involved have recouped their research costs, which could run into billions of dollars.

Riad invested 275 million dirhams in the plant. The plant aimed to produce 5,000 vehicles, mainly small trucks, per year to supply the Moroccan market before expanding output later to export to West Africa, Middle East and Asia. Riad signed deals with Chinese vehicle-maker Sinotruk , Mudan and Baw, to supply the assembly plant to be located in Settat region, near Casablanca -- Morocco's commercial capital.

Vice-President Kavindele said the cost of sending patients outside Zambia was too high.Egyptian Ambassador to Zambia Abadelgghaffar Eldib said the inspection of the site would be done by experts on July 7, this year before the construction could be commenced. Vice-President Kavindele said the Zambian government was indebted to the Egyptian government for many things it had done which include the sending of doctors to lecture at the University of Zambia School of Medicine.He also disclosed that four of the doctors had already arrived while the rest were expected soon after the OAU summit. 'Not only that, but when I was in Egypt I had a discussion with President Mubarak who generously offered to send more highly trained doctors to beef up our medical facilities and work in what is to be one of the most highly sophisticated hospitals,' he said. Ambassador Eldib said his government had also invested in a rice growing project in Chanyanya area which he said would be very sustainable. Earlier Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Peng Keyu also donated equipment worth US$600,000 which included computer software, printers, uniform for the brass band and other operational machinery and US$500,000 cash. Ambassador Keyu said China was committed to bringing investment in Zambia.He said there was already more than US$200million investment in the country through various Chinese companies. Vice-President Kavindele said the relations between China and Zambia would continue to grow because of the growing unconditional co-operation. He said the Chinese government had also offered road construction equipment.'The equipment is here so that most of our feeder roads are graded so that our farmers can have access to the markets,' said Vice-President Kavindele.

"2308","China","800 million dollars in investment to Zambia (duplicate)","2007","false","China's Hu announces giant investments in ZambiaDJ681 words4 February 200704:38 AMAgence France PresseAFPREnglishCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2007 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved.LUSAKA, Feb 4, 2007 (AFP) -Chinese President Hu Jintao unveiled more than 800 million dollars in investment and debt waivers as he toured Zambia, where escalating anti-Sino feelings have forced Lusaka to tone down his programme.Hu's flagship announcement was a fresh injection of 800 million dollars to develop copper mines in Zambia, one of the world's top producers of the ore, in the northern region of Chambeshi.The visiting leader, who arrived in Lusaka on Saturday on the latest leg of his eight-nation swing through Africa, also said Beijing was writing off Zambia's bilateral debt due last year totalling nearly eight million dollars.He said China, the third largest foreign investor in Zambia, would extend 150,000 dollars in cash to help with damage caused by recent floods.Other measures include building schools, hospitals and an agriculture technology centre.The president's itinerary for Sunday was severely curtailed by Lusaka in the wake of planned protests against the alleged exploitation of local workers by Chinese firms and the supposed plunder of the country's mineral resources.A trip to a Chinese-run copper mine in the north, where a blast in 2005 killed 50 Zambians, was cancelled after reports of planned demonstrations.Hu had also been due to commission a 200-million-dollar copper smelter in Chambeshi and lay the foundation stone of a giant Chinese-funded stadium at Ndola in the country's Copperbelt province.Zambia has enforced tight security during the trip, confined Hu to Lusaka and not invited main opposition leader Michael Sata, a vitriolic critic of Beijing, to any public function with the visiting leader.Hu on Sunday met with Zambia's founding president Kenneth Kaunda after holding talks with parliament speaker Amussa Mwanamwambwa.He was later scheduled to launch a Sino-Zambian economic trade cooperation zone with his Zambian counterpart Levy Mwanawasa.Mwanawasa, in a banquet speech late Saturday, tried to play down the controversy over the Chinese juggernaut in his country.'The decision by your government to establish a special economic zone here in Zambia is the most welcome development,' he told Hu.'Apart from creating the much-needed employment opportunities, it will produce a culture of adding value to our own materials,' he said, underlining that 'the transfer of technology will be considered as a deliberate policy.'Hu meanwhile stressed that ties between Zambia, the first southern African nation to establish diplomatic links with China 42 years ago, and Beijing had 'endured the test of changes in the international arena and both countries' domestic situation.'He also thanked Zambia for its unswerving commitment to the one-China policy.Chinese investment in Zambia -- mainly in mining, textile and construction -- has soared in recent years but the litany of complaints is growing.Many Zambians accuse Chinese companies of paying low wages, ignoring basic safety standards and bringing scores of Chinese workers in to do jobs meant to be reserved for locals.Last week, workers of the recently closed Zambia-China Mulungushi Textiles, the country's largest textile mill, protested outside the Chinese embassy to complain about poor wages, mistreatment and the temporary closure of the plant because of massive losses.Despite the protests, Hu was quoted by China's Xinhua news agency as saying that economic cooperation between China and Africa was mutually beneficial and carried out on a level playing field.Zambia is Hu's fourth stop in Africa after Cameroon, Liberia and Sudan. He travels on Monday to Namibia followed by South Africa, Mozambique and the Seychelles.China, which is avidly courting Africa for its oil and energy resources, recently said it would write off debts owed by 33 countries on the world's poorest continent as part of a multi-billion-dollar pledge made last year.Sino-African trade reached 55.5 billion dollars last year, a more than five-fold increase from 10.79 billion dollars in 2001, according to official Chinese figures.

It is expected that the project will be completed by August 2008 to enable the smelter to commence copper processing,' Sisala said in a statement.Investors from China will build leach and brick-making plants, and others to treat slag from the mines into finished copper. Expansion of the Chambishi copper mine, owned by China's NFC Africa, was also in the pipeline.The government said earlier this year that Chinese companies would also set up manufacturing plants and agricultural processing factories in the Chambishi MFEZ.Officials say China has pledged to invest $1.2 billion in two economic zones, including one for high-technology manufacturing firms in Lusaka. Of that investment, $900 million is earmarked for Chambishi.In July, Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa said he would fight political opponents trying to limit or frustrate Chinese investments in the mineral-rich southern African nation.The main opposition Patriotic Front (PF) party won parliamentary polls in the mineral-rich Copper Belt province, after its leader campaigned on an anti-China platform in 2006 presidential and parliamentary elections.Zambia became the first African country to experience riots over charges against Chinese firms of poor labour relations, poor safety standards and low wages paid to local miners.In 2005, 50 workers died at BIGRMM Zambia Ltd, a Chinese-run firm after an explosion which experts said was caused by poor safety standards.The state Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) granted BIGRMM a new licence in June to set up another plant despite resistance from families of the dead workers.Chambishi is one of five economic zones China plans to set up across Africa as Beijing strengthens its economic partnership with the continent, which has abundant natural resources and cheap labour.ZAMBIA-CHINA/ELECTRICITY|LANGEN|ABN|E|RBN|AFN|Z|RNP|DNP|PCO","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070831e38v001du&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Government shall prioritise its resource allocation to the electricity sub-sector,' he said.He said the energy sector, specifically electricity, played a critical role in facilitating growth of the economy.The Kariba North Bank extension project would involve the installation of two additional generators with a total capacity of 360 mega watts. This will bring the total installed capacity at the Kariba North Bank to 1,080 mega watts.Mr Banda said in cognisance of the role that electricity played in the sustainable growth of the country, the Government, in addition to the project which was launched yesterday, would work on the Kafue Gorge Lower hydropower project at a cost of about $1.5 billion.Mr Banda said the Itezhi-Tezhi hydropower project of 120 mega watts would cost Government $200million.He said the 210-mega watts Kalungushi hydropower project would cost about $400 million.And Mr Banda thanked the Chinese government for facilitating the provision of 85 per cent of the cost of the project through the China Export and Import Bank and the Development Bank of Southern Africa for providing the balance of the project funds.Energy and Water Development Minister, Kenneth Konga said the expansion project at Kariba North Bank was a milestone in Zambia's energy sector and that the Government had realised the need for new power stations.Mr Konga said electricity was one of the key drivers for development, saying there had been little development in the sector for a long time.Chinese ambassador to Zambia, Li Qiangmin said the project demonstrated the cordial bilateral relations by the Zambian and Chinese governments.Mr Li said Zambia was one of the preferred investors' destinations by the Chinese because of its good policies which they had taken advantage of.He said the company contracted to do the works, Sino Hydro, was the biggest power company in China and one of the largest in the world.Southern Province Minister, Daniel Munkombwe urged Zesco to consider giving priority to the local people when they start employing general workers.Southern Africa head international finance, William Lugemwa, said his bank was keen to support infrastructure projects with a clear focus on development and the communities.Zesco managing director, Rodney Sisala said the project would not only be beneficial to Zambia but the entire Southern African Development Community region.Document AFNWS00020090309e539000wd","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Implementation","2","Unset","Unset","","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020090309e539000wd&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The lowest paid worker at CLM gets a monthly salary of K1, 224,000.Speaking when Mr Mwale, Mr Liato and Copperbelt Minister Mwansa Mbulakulima toured the mine's concentrator and the Muliashi Mine project sites yesterday, Mr Luo said the CLM management and Mineworkers Union of Zambia (MUZ) and National Union for Miners and Allied Workers (NUMAW) were coordinating well.Mr Luo said although the mine had engaged more than 37 local and foreign contractors, most of the qualified personnel working for most of the former contractors had been re-engaged by the mine.He said the CLM had over the past six months been undertaking the rebuilding and rehabilitation works of Baluba Mine.'Already we have done the necessary preparations of viability of the conditions needed for production. We are scheduled to do the first blasting of the copper pre-underground on December 14,' he said.Mr Luo said the mine's concentrator was undergoing a complete overhaul with all the five crushers being replaced by modern ones and so far, three out of five had been replaced while two new crushers were still in transit.He said the hard work being exhibited by the Zambian workers was helping in enhancing production at CLM.CLM deputy chief executive officer in charge of technical services, Robert Kamanga said all was set to ensure that the Muliashi Open Pit Mine project and seven oxide camps were made operational next year.Mr Mwale said the Government was impressed with the manner in which a lot of work had been done at the mine within a short period of time.He said the rate at which the mine was being developed had left those doubting about the viability of Chinese investment with no option but to join those who wanted to allow the Chinese to work with the Zambian people as partners in development.The minister said there was need for all those working on the mines to ensure that the Zambian and Chinese cultures converged to all the people from the two countries.Mr Mbulakulima said construction of a 7.6-kilometre-long tarred road from the mine's offices to the Muliashi mining site at a cost of K8.2 billion, which was being incurred by the mine even before the commencement of production, was a clear testimony of how serious CLM was as an investor in the mining sector.Document AFNWS00020091210e5ca000yb","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020091210e5ca000yb&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Additionally, in fulfilment of pledges made at last year's Forum on China-Africa Co-operation, Niger and China have signed a US$5.3-million economic and technical co-operation agreement, according to an African Press Agency (APA) report. The money will be used for the construction of two rural schools and rehabilitation of the General Seyni Kountouch stadium. The first, and at present only, Nigerien bridge across the River Niger was built in 1972 with U.S. assistance.Significance: Construction of the new bridge is expected to be completed by mid-2011 and it is hoped that congestion on Niger's first and only bridge across the river will be reduced as a result.

All Rights Reserved.LOME, Togo (AP) - As followers drummed and danced, Togo President Gnassingbe Eyadema laid the corner stone for a new multimillion-dollar presidential palace being built by the Chinese for the poor west African nation.Telecommunications Minister Faure Gnassingbe -- the president's son -- called the project 'a priority for Togo,' saying it would give the nation a palace 'befitting the dignity and status of a modern presidency.'Chinese diplomats and Togo leaders at Thursday's ceremony declined to give an exact price.The palace is the latest high-profile gift from the Chinese as they vie across Africa and much of the developing world for diplomatic recognition, in competition with Taiwan.Chinese also are competing with the West for oil, minerals and other resources in many West African nations.Other Chinese-built landmarks for Togo include a recently constructed US$36 million sports stadium, a hospital, and the Palace of Congress.Laying the cornerstone, Eyadema declared, 'The people of Togo are happy to celebrate with you the glory of Sino-Togolese friendship.'Eyadema took power in 1967 after Africa's first post-colonial coup, and stands today as Africa's longest-ruling leader.International rights organizations accuse his regime of suppressing the opposition and charge him with widespread rights abuses, and most aid to the tiny country remains frozen.A nation dependent mostly on commercial and subsistence agriculture, Togo has more than one-third of its 5.4 million people living in poverty. With development and economic reform stalled, roads and other infrastructure are crumbling.Opposition leaders condemned the mansion project.'What Togo needs is a solid foundation for the country's move toward multiparty democracy,' said Cornelius Aidam, vice president of the Convergence Pan African Patriotic Party.

The offer was made on Monday during bilateral talks shortly before Chinese President Hu Jintao wrapped up his brief visit of barely 23 hours to Namibia yesterday morning. After talks with Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba on Monday, a new grant and an interest-free loan agreement worth N$60 million were signed at a brief public signing ceremony. The state visit culminated with a banquet held in honour of Hu and his 130-member delegation. The Permanent Secretary in the Finance Ministry confirmed the huge amount yesterday afternoon. 'The N$1 billion is in the form of a concessional loan, which means that Namibia can use those funds on projects it will decide on,' Calle Schlettwein told The Namibian. 'The second offer of US$ 00 million (about N$720 million) is a concessional credit line. This will enable our Government to acquire goods, services and equipment from China,' Schlettwein added. He said Government still had to decide whether it would accept the offer. 'We will then have to decide on which projects we will use those funds and then negotiate the loan terms,' he explained. After Hu's departure, the two countries issued a joint communique, but the loan offer was not mentioned. Namibia and China expressed their satisfaction with the strong ties that exist between them as well as political trust and good co-operation. 'Both heads of state recognised the achievements made in trade and agreed to work together to strengthen co-operation in mining, agriculture, tourism, manufacturing and human resources development,' the communique stated. Both countries now have four agreements in place: trade and economic co-operation, establishing a joint commission on trade and economic co-operation, a reciprocal treaty for the protection of trade and investments for both Chinese and Namibian businesspeople in China and Namibia. The fourth agreement was signed in Beijing last November during the Forum for China-Africa Co-operation (Focac). The Namibia Investment Centre and a similar institution in China, the China investment Promotion Agency (CIPA), agreed to promote and facilitate investment between the two countries. After Hu left, some 35 Chinese businesspeople who are part of his official delegation remained behind in Windhoek for a business presentation on Namibia as an investment destination. It was organised by the Namibia Investment Centre and the Ministry of Trade and Industry and some 50 Namibian captains of industry attended the session. Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko called on the Chinese executives to form joint ventures with their Namibian counterparts and to invest in local value addition of the country's raw materials. 'It is imperative that during all your deliberations and interactions, value addition should become your central strategy of engagement,' Ngatjizeko urged.

India, April 29 -- A $1.2 billion construction contract for a new airport in the Sudanese capital Khartoum has been signed by a stateowned Chinese company. The new airport will have a runway long enough for the giant Airbus A380, says China Communications Construction Company, and added that the new airport will strengthen Sudan's international ties, which have suffered due to sanctions and a poor aviation safety record.China is Sudan' biggest investor, with most of its investment in the oil sector. Sudan, being listed as a state sponsor of terrorism by the US, is banned from using the US currency for trade, thus making it diffi cult for international companies such as airlines to conduct business there.However, the US has hinted that it may lift sanctions if the Sudanese government lets the oil-rich south Sudan live peacefully.

As a result, a Sino/South African joint venture was recently established in view of looking into the feasibility of building 2 CTL plants in China. The partners in the planned undertaking include SASOL LTD. of South Africa in addition to the local SHENHUA COAL LIQUEFACTION CORP. and NINGXIA COAL. Construction plans under consideration call for building units based on the CTL technology used at SASOL's 155 000 barrel per day (b/d) plant at Secunda, South Africa. These are expected to cost $3,000,000,000 each to build. In so doing, production output is expected to amount to around 80 000 b/d of petroleum fuels and chemicals. SASOL employs a total workforce of approximately 31,000 and operates as a holding company. The group is engaged in the mining and distribution of coal as well as being acknowledged to be a world leader in the conversion of coal to oil and gas.

China's assistant minister for commerce, Fu Ziying, made the announcement during the signing of five protocols on economic and technical cooperation with finance minister, Dr. Ezra Suruma. The agreements signed included; the protocol on cancellation of the $17m debt, an agreement to provide a grant of $6.8m (sh12b) and a letter of exchange for the construction of a government office block. Other protocols signed were for the construction of two rural schools and a hospital. He said China had granted tariff-free and quota-free treatment to more than 400 commodities from Uganda, while coffee was granted preferential treatment. Ziying said China would intensify efforts to convince more Chinese companies to invest in Uganda. 'About 20 years ago, Chinese enterprises were like the Ugandan small and medium enterprises, lacking knowledge on expanding to the international market. We have experience on trade promotion. In future under a training programme, we can provide specific training on exploring international markets for SMEs,' Ziying said.

The 400 mW of electricity will be imported via the Caprivi line from Zambia by 2009. The chief technical adviser of NamPower, Rainer Jagau, confirmed this. However, he stressed that, as was the case with other offers from various places, NamPower would carefully compare the proposals with conditions elsewhere on the open market. According to Mr Jagau it is however not a settled thing that CAMC would be a partner in the Caprivi project. The link of northern Namibia over Sesheke and Livingstone to the power network of the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation [Zesco] will according to reports cost about 3 billion Namibian dollars. The ability to supplement Namibia's power demands on a large scale from this quarter depends amongst others on upgrading in Zambia, which has been topping the agenda of Zesco for the past years.According to Mr Jagau the infrastructure for the Caprivi line should be completed by 2009. He therefore stressed that NamPower's strategy for the next years, like in South Africa and Zambia, would be to economize.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","230","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020060616e26g002ut&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

'Part of the funds will also be used to support State hospitals,' said Ren Xiaoping, the new Chinese Ambassador to Namibia.'We also signed for the dispatch of a Chinese expert team to Namibia to conduct a feasibility study on the agricultural project of Ndonga Linea in the Kavango Region,' Angula said.//Windhoek, Jan 28, 2008 (New Era/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Chinese Government gave the Namibian Government a grant of RMB Yuan 20 million to build two rural schools in the Omuthiya and Tsumkwe areas.The Namibian Government has chosen the localities for the schools, with the Chinese completing the design of the two schools. The new Chinese Ambassador to Namibia, Ren Xiaoping, said her government would also give a RMB Yuan 30 million interest-free loan to its Namibian counterpart to go towards specific projects still to be discussed.The Chinese will similarly give the Namibian Government a N$1 billion preferential loan, and extend a US$100 million credit line to the Government's commercial agencies. Signing the agreement on behalf of the Namibian Government on Friday, National Planning Commission Director Helmuth Angula said some of the money would go towards the building of a rural hospital with a capacity of 60 beds. Other projects likely to benefit from the cooperation are the irrigation project at the National Youth Development Centre of the National Youth Council and the completion of the northern railway line.The two governments also signed exchange letters that deal with the dispatch of a Chinese expert team to Namibia to conduct a feasibility study on the Agricultural Project of Ndonga Linena in the Kavango Region.","Other (see notes)","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020070420e34k000z0&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"11439","China","Scholarships to Namibian students","2007","false","Chinese benefaction to Namibia in particular held steadfast on Monday when President Hu Jintao announced a N$1-billion soft loan and also offered N$60 million in the form of an interest-free loan, a grant and dozens of scholarships.Hu made the announcement in Windhoek during the fifth leg of his marathon tour of eight African countries some of which have received substantial sums of money in aid while in the same vein benefiting from debt-cancellation from the Asian giant.Hu said during talks with President Hifikepunye Pohamba that China would further avail US$100 million in buyers' credit and build youth-training centres in Namibia.Because Namibia is among the few African countries officially designated a tourism destination by the Chinese government, some of the money would go towards boosting its market share of the rapidly expanding Chinese tourism industry, particularly group tours.During the official talks on Monday that preceded the signing ceremony for the soft loans and other bilateral aid, Pohamba told his counterpart that Namibia has numerous opportunities for investment in the fields of agriculture, tourism, aquaculture, mining, energy, technology and infrastructure and human development.'In this regard, we are inviting Chinese entrepreneurs to come and form joint ventures and other business partnerships with their Namibian counterparts for the mutual benefit of both countries,' Pohamba said at the meeting held with Hu at a local hotel.He assured Chinese investors that they have nothing to fear because Namibia offers a conducive business environment in line with the Reciprocal Treaty on the Promotion and Protection of Investment signed by the two nations.China's tremendous economic and social growth, elevating it to a global economic powerhouse, was also commended by President Pohamba who said Namibia 'would like to emulate' the Asian nation's successes and learn from 'your tremendous experience'.'Namibia needs partners in the promotion and realization of industrial development, investment and local value addition which are all critical for the achievement of our national development goals as set out in our National Development Plans and Vision 2030,' the Head of State said at a meeting that included several cabinet ministers.He said the recent Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation reached common ground on major international political and economic issues, especially on the reform of the United Nations and the maintenance of international peace and security.'Namibia supports the China-Africa policy, which is based on peaceful co-existence and anchored on the values of sincerity, equality and mutual common development,' he said.And Namibia being a member of the Troika of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security, shall continue to support regional efforts aimed at conflict prevention.And equally important Pohamba reaffirmed his government's full support 'for the one-China policy and to reiterate our position that Taiwan is an integral part of China.'Hu said the cooperation between Namibia and China has been growing steadfastly in the fields of politics, economics, education, public health and culture.Since taking office in March 2005, Pohamba has actively promoted bilateral ties with China, and according to the news agency AP, trade between the two nations in the first 11 months of 2006 amounted to US$240 million, an increase of 103 percent from 2005.Hu, whose 130-strong delegation included his wife Liu Yongqing and several senior ministers and high-ranking officials, left yesterday morning for South Africa.//CHINA has offered Government one billion Namibian dollars as a concessional loan over a three-year period until 2010, plus another N$720 million as a credit line, The Namibian established yesterday.The offer was made on Monday during bilateral talks shortly before Chinese President Hu Jintao wrapped up his brief visit of barely 23 hours to Namibia yesterday morning.After talks with Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba on Monday, a new grant and an interest-free loan agreement worth N$60 million were signed at a brief public signing ceremony.The state visit culminated with a banquet held in honour of Hu and his 130-member delegation.The Permanent Secretary in the Finance Ministry confirmed the huge amount yesterday afternoon.'The N$1 billion is in the form of a concessional loan, which means that Namibia can use those funds on projects it will decide on,' Calle Schlettwein told The Namibian.'The second offer of US$ 00 million (about N$720 million) is a concessional credit line.This will enable our Government to acquire goods, services and equipment from China,' Schlettwein added.He said Government still had to decide whether it would accept the offer.'We will then have to decide on which projects we will use those funds and then negotiate the loan terms,' he explained.After Hu's departure, the two countries issued a joint communique, but the loan offer was not mentioned.Namibia and China expressed their satisfaction with the strong ties that exist between them as well as political trust and good co-operation.'Both heads of state recognised the achievements made in trade and agreed to work together to strengthen co-operation in mining, agriculture, tourism, manufacturing and human resources development,' the communique stated.Both countries now have four agreements in place: trade and economic co-operation, establishing a joint commission on trade and economic co-operation, a reciprocal treaty for the protection of trade and investments for both Chinese and Namibian businesspeople in China and Namibia.The fourth agreement was signed in Beijing last November during the Forum for China-Africa Co-operation (Focac).The Namibia Investment Centre and a similar institution in China, the China investment Promotion Agency (CIPA), agreed to promote and facilitate investment between the two countries.After Hu left, some 35 Chinese businesspeople who are part of his official delegation remained behind in Windhoek for a business presentation on Namibia as an investment destination.It was organised by the Namibia Investment Centre and the Ministry of Trade and Industry and some 50 Namibian captains of industry attended the session.Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko called on the Chinese executives to form joint ventures with their Namibian counterparts and to invest in local value addition of the country's raw materials.'It is imperative that during all your deliberations and interactions, value addition should become your central strategy of engagement,' Ngatjizeko urged.//Mar 27, 2007 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --GOVERNMENT will engage a Chinese software company to install an electronic management system for the public service.Cabinet approved that the Office of the Prime Minister could secure funding under a concessional loan agreement signed last month between China and Namibia during the state visit of Chinese president Hu Jintao for the implementation of an Electronic Documentation and Records Management System (EDRMS) across the public service.This is viewed as a critical project in terms of existing e-governance policy directives.China offered over N$1 billion as a loan for projects to be identified by Namibia.The EDRMS project team evaluated various appropriate software solutions and found that the system offered by Chinese outfit CA-China SS Software Technology would be best suited for the requirements of the Namibian public service.'The system is not only government user friendly, but also offers easy-to-use interfaces and robust application software that will link up with already familiar public service platforms to ensure records and archival compliance,' Information Minister Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah told reporters last week.Cabinet therefore endorsed the EDRMS under the auspices of the Office of the Prime Minister on condition that it complies with tender procedures.Cabinet instructed the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Commission to discuss the conditions, terms, modality of accessing the preferential loan and credit facility to finance the EDRMS and other priority projects in Namibia with the Chinese Government.Cabinet also granted approval for the arrangement of the grant and the use of the concessional loans for the EDRMS project by the Export-Import Bank of China, subject to concurrence by the Chinese Government.The company CA-CSS is a joint venture formed by New York-based commercial software associates (CA) and China National Computer Software   Technology Service Corporation (CS S).The primary goal of the joint venture was to explore the huge potential presented by the Chinese software market by leveraging the resources and expertise from both parties.The company's head office is in Beijing, China.//Bilateral trade aside, the visit to Namibia in 2007 of Chinese President Hu Jintao during his historic tour of several African countries, resulted in China offering Namibia concessional loans amounting to RMB1 billion. And it also generously extended a preferential line of credit that is interest-free to the tune of US$100 million.From the concessional loan, an amount of RMB41 million was used for the procurement of software and for the implementation of the e-governance project for Namibia, while RMB300 million was used for the procurement of X-ray equipment from China.RMB645 million from the concessional loan funded three developmental projects including for the implementation of one of the phases of the Northern Railway Line as well as the upgrading of the Oshakati State Hospital in northern Namibia, which she noted: 'was very run down and needed to be upgraded'.Part of these funds was used to give a facelift and expansion of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), whose facilities were built during the colonial era.'The Namibian side is satisfied with the implementation of these projects,' she said.She said since her deployment as Chinese Ambassador to Namibia, she has worked tirelessly to ensure that the eight areas of cooperation measures promised by President Hu Jintao at the China Africa Summit held in Beijing in 2006 such as the provision of full support to African countries, that such as assistance to rural schools and hospitals are fulfilled.'Since I came to Namibia, I have been working very hard to implement the eight measures promised by President Hu Jintao at the China-Africa Beijing Summit. Since my arrival, my job was to consolidate different relations and to further the friendship and areas of cooperation. Since my arrival, our mutual trust has grown,' she said.The eight measures announced by the Chinese president included the doubling of grant assistance and providing US$3 billion soft loans and US$2 billion preferential buyer's credit in three years setting up a China-Africa development fund which will be injected with US$5 billion to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Africa.Other measures are: building a conference centre for the African Union, cancelling debts owed by heavily indebted and the least developed African countries, further opening up China's vast market to Africa by largely increasing the number of African export items to China that receive zero-tariff treatment and strengthening cooperation in the fields of agriculture, human resource enhancement, health and education.The inception of the Forum of China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) brought tangible benefits to Namibia such as the building of the regional council buildings in Rundu and Outapi, the New State House, the fishery laboratory at Kamutjonga Inland Fisheries Institute in Kavango, the Defence Academy (Okahandja), and the Youth Training Centre.China also availed grants amounting to RMB20 million and it helped to fund a large hospital at Omuthiya where a groundbreaking ceremony has occurred.She said China has provided over 300 training opportunities to Namibians in various fields while at the same time it has seconded a medical team at the Katutura State Hospital. There are several Chinese experts working at grassroots level while rural women and youth empowerment projects have all benefited from China's generosity.At current exchange rates, US$1 is equivalent to RMB6.8.//No18, 2011 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE Ministry of Works and Transport has drawn Government into taking a Chinese loan that was rejected two years ago as 'onerous' in a road-building contract that has also bypassed official open tender process.The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, George Simataa, told The Namibian that the construction of the two roads - between Omakange and Ruacana and between Omafo and Outapi in northern Namibia - will be funded with a Chinese loan but that the Ministry of Finance is yet to apply or approve the loan. The roads are expected to cost about N$1 billion.The Namibian has it on good authority that the loan in question is the same controversial package that the Government ditched in 2009 after Teko Trading, a company owned by two Namibians and a Chinese national now facing corruption charges, was exposed as having received kic-backs of N$120 million from China when the Government bought customs scanning equipment for N$550 million.Teko Trading was said to be the 'local representative' for Nuctech (the Chinese company) although the Ministry of Finance said it had no knowledge of the company's dubious middle-man role.Teko Trading, owned by Public Service Commissioner Teckla Lameck, Kongo Mokaxwa and Chinese national Yung Fan, were supposed to be the 'local representatives' for China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export, and were experted to earn at least 10 per cent 'commission' from the N$1,1 billion tender to complete the 65km northern railway line between Ondangwa and Oshikango.Government dropped that loan agreement, with then Permanent Secretary of Finance Calle Schlettwein calling it 'onerous' and Simataa arguing in documents that the loan was 'risky because of foreign exchange fluctuations'.In a series of e-mails this week, Simataa said two Chinese firms, China Gezhouba Group International Engineering and China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export, have been selected to build the two roads mentioned earlier.While his reply on Tuesday was categorical that the two companies were selected to do the job, after he was asked to elaborate or give definite answers, on Wednesday he changed saying they still have to negotiate and agree on pricing after which they will sign technical and framework agreements.'It is only at that stage that the Ministry of Finance will be approached to apply for a loan from the Chinese Government,' Simataaa said in an e-mail on Wednesday.Asked if it is a condition of the loan that the work be given to Chinese companies he was evasive, saying 'these are Chinese-financed projects. One of their conditions is that the projects should be carried [out] by Chinese firms'.Having already gone ahead with the project, Simataa would also not say for certain whether the ministry was given tender exemption for the work, saying only that proper tender regulations were followed. When pressed if the construction of the two roads were put out on official and open tender Simataa said 'no', citing Chinese loan conditions that Chinese companies be used on the projects. Simataa and the Ministry of Works have been named in research documents as the main culprits in regularly demanding and getting exemptions from public tender regulations.It is unclear why Simataa and the ministry have decided to return to the Chinese loan that they criticised a couple of years ago. There are no indications this time that Teko Trading would be involved.The China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export northern railway line contract was cancelled after it was challenged in the High Court because of alleged tender irregularities.","Education","","110","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020070207e327000d2&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The money will also lay roads and electrify slum areas of the capital, Luanda, and also fund rehabilitation of the water supply systems Updated description: On March 2, 2004 the first Credit Accord with the Eximbank of China was signed for a financial package of two billion US Dollars and meant for the financing of projects of Angola's public investment. The first package was implemented in two different phases, with each taking one billion US Dollars. The first phase involved 27 contracts, corresponding to 50 projects, of which 21 have been completed. These projects focused on areas of electricity, water, health, education, public works, each of which taking about 20 percent of the total amount released.The second phase included 13 contracts and 52 projects that are underway. These contracts are in the areas of telecommunications, fisheries, health, education and public works.A contract is near approval to complete the second phase. The contract is called EDEL III, plus another two in final stage of negotiation, also in the sector of electricity and waters.The balance at the end of September 2007, according to the Finance Ministry, is of Usd 7.1 million, of which Usd 1.6 million are for the first phase of the financing and Usd 5.4 million for the second phase.The total amount disbursed until the end of September is Usd 932.9 million, being 733.1 million for the first phase and 199.8 for the second phase.As a result of the positive evaluation made by the two parties concerning the first package of two billion US Dollars, a memorandum of understanding was signed on June 20, 2006, between the Angolan Finance Ministry and China's Eximbank, for the granting of a new financing of the same amount.; Contractor Comment: Tied to the loan, is the agreement that the public tenders for the construction and civil engineering contracts will be awarded primarily to Chinese state-owned enterprises approved by the Chinese government.

All Rights Reserved. No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.Excerpt from report by Cisse Aboubacar entitled 'The world-Diplomacy: The state of Chinese-Guinean cooperation' published on Guineenews website based in Canada but with editorial team in Guinea on 12 AprilDiplomacy: the state of the Chinese-Guinean cooperation on the eve of the opening of the fifth joint bilateral commission of cooperation of the countries in Conakry.The fifth session of the joint grand commission of bilateral cooperation between China and Guinea will take place in Conakry on 13 and 14 April 2011. The high powered delegation led by the Chinese deputy minister of trade, Fu Ziyinc, which will take part in the discussions, is arriving by a special flight from Peking on this 13 April for a session which is beginning with the visit to the construction site of the 50,000 seating capacity stadium at Nongo and the commissioning of the Kipe International Hospital which are both donations from China.According to the technicians at the Ministry of International Cooperation of our country, 'the Chinese-Guinean diplomatic ties which date back to October 1956 and the dominant characteristics of which are discreet, are achieved mainly through interest free loans, completed by financial grants, donations of food and pharmaceutical product, budgetary aids and military assistance'. Several accomplishments are also among this cooperation on the level of agriculture, industry, handicraft, infrastructure, trade, energy, health, education, training and telecommunications among others. They are achievements that contributed greatly to the socio-economic development of Guinea.On the education level, for instance, China gave Guinea 300 scholarships in the areas higher and post-university education and in the fields of architecture, mathematics, food technology, biochemistry, agriculture and health in the last 13 years. However, in the case of health, 22 Chinese medical missions have been circulating between Conakry, Labe, Faranah and N'Zerekore on the basis of a biannual renewable contract from 1968. The training of over 140 health workers of all categories is also in this programme.On the trade level, statistics show that commercial exchange between our two countries which were up to the tune of 43m dollars in 2002 rise to about 200m dollars currently. With the admission of Peking in 2004 into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Chinese authorities gave a quota of 87 products to Guinea from the following year under special customs preferential tariff treatment.It should be noted that Guinea received from China in cash and kind a total sum of nearly 7m dollars from 1984, under the terms of this donation, for the purchase of rice seeds, tractors, learning materials for the deaf and dumb, building and telecommunications materials and fertilizers etc.Under infrastructures, the Sekhoutoureya Presidential Palace, the Kinkon and Tinkisso hydroelectric plants, the Kipe International Hospital, the People's Palace, the RTG [state-owned Guinean Radio-Television] Broadcasting House at Koloma, the Chinese-Guinean Friendship Schools at Coyah, the 50,000 sitting capacity stadium at Nongo which is being built are among the showpieces of this cooperation.We should note finally that about 40 Chinese technical assistants are currently working on various Chinese-Guinean cooperation projects, without speaking of the multitude of Chinese private companies which give birth to a massive presence of Chinese nationals in our country.It is therefore in this favourable atmosphere that the discussions on the fifth session of the Chinese-Guinean joint grand commission of bilateral cooperation is opening on Wednesday [13 April], which is the harbinger of bright prospects for the deepening and diversification of this over five decade old cooperation based on a win-win policy.Source: Guineenews website in French 12 Apr 11adaa7181Document BBCAP00020110413e74d002e5","Government and Social Services","public stadium","","Implementation","2","Unset","Unset","","Guinea","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020110413e74d002e5&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All rights reserved.China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) has drilled a duster at the remote Tenere Block in eastern Niger, Canadian junior partner TG World Energy said Thursday.The Tenere Block is operated by CNPC affiliate CNPC International (Tenere), which conducted drill stem tests over two intervals on the Saha-1 well. 'Although oil flowed from one such interval, water was also encountered during the test and the well will not be capable of commercial production,' TG World, which has a 20% interest in the block, said. The test over the second interval was incomplete.TG World will be carried by CNPC for most of its share of the work program, which includes the drilling of three exploration wells and all seismic acquisition, processing and interpretation until the end of the second well. Some 3,780 km of new 2-D seismic has been acquired and interpreted so far, TG World said.CNPC is now preparing to move to the second drilling location, Fachi West-1, in the next few days.The Tenere Block covers 71,200 sq km (27,500 sq miles) and contains the northern half of the Termit-Tenere Rift. The southern half is beside the Agadem contract area held by Exxon Mobil and Malaysia'sPetronas, where six oil discoveries and one gas discovery have been made. But Exxon says it would require a find of at least 1 billion bbl to justify a 1,000 km plus link to the crude export pipeline in neighboring Chad, or a new line crossing North Africa to the Mediterranean.Document IOD0000020070309e3320000u","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Niger","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=IOD0000020070309e3320000u&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved.The China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) has spudded a second exploration well in Niger. Drilling at the Fachi West-1 well on the Ténéré Block began on 7 April. TG World Energy Corp.holds a 20% interest in the CNPC-operated concession. TG World's previous exploration well Saha-1 was announced a duster last month (see Niger: 13 March 2007:). The Operator mobilised the rig northwards across lateral dunes from the Saha-1 location approximately 27 km overland to the second location.Significance: TG World President and CEO Cliff James stated that analysis of the Saha-1 data suggests that the Fachi West-1 location remains a compelling prospect. TG World is being carried by CNPC for its 20% share for the first three exploration wells. Niger has proven reserves of 300 million barrels of oil yet the country is landlocked and needs to find considerable reserves of at least one billion barrels of oil for the construction of a new pipeline to be made viable.Document WDAN000020070411e34b00034","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Implementation","2","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Niger","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020070411e34b00034&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"15186","China","Uranium Deposit Development (Duplicate of 256)","2007","false","400 words18 May 200703:57 AMReuters NewsLBAEnglish(c) 2007 Reuters LimitedBEIJING, May 18 (Reuters) - China Nuclear International Uranium Corp. said on Friday it has signed an agreement with Chinese iron ore miner and trader Sinosteel Corp. and investment conglomerate CITIC to explore for and develop uranium resources in China and abroad.The firm plans to develop a uranium deposit in Niger in cooperation with that country's government, and is looking for other partners for projects elsewhere, Liu Xuehong, the company's deputy general manager, told a power industry conference.'Even though domestic reserves can meet our needs, in the long term we need to develop overseas supply sources,' she said.China will need more than 8,000 tonnes of uranium to feed its planned nuclear power generation capacity, which is expected to reach 40 gigawatts by 2020, she estimated.Anticipation of rising demand has driven up spot uranium prices to about $120 a pound from $10/lb a few years ago, and is fuelling new mining projects world-wide.Niger, the world's third-largest uranium producer, this week approved more than $60 million in additional budget funds to confront nomadic Tuareg rebels in the arid north, home to many of its uranium concessions.Part of the funds derived from contractual payments by Chinese oil and uranium companies, Niger's minister of internal relations said.CNIUC, or SinoU, was established at the end of last year to develop overseas uranium resources for its parent, China National Nuclear Corp.It would develop Niger's Tiguidda deposit in Azelik, she said.CNNC last July won the rights to a 12,790 tonne deposit along the Azelik fault. It also holds rights to the 6,190 tonne Madaouela deposit, according to the World Nuclear Association.China's primary domestic uranium deposits lie in the Yili and Tuha basins, both in the far western desert region of Xinjiang, and in the Erdos region of Inner Mongolia, Liu said.Demand for uranium will outstrip 'fairly substantial' production capacity coming up in the next five years, said Andrej Karpinski, executive chairman of exploration firm Korab Resources Ltd. and of its spin-off Uranium Australia Ltd.He predicted uranium prices could rise as high as $200/lb this year or next, before settling between $70/lb and $120/lb as new mines begin production.CHINA-URANIUM|LANGEN|ABN|C|MTL|GRO|SOF|O|OILDocument LBA0000020070518e35i001fl","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Niger","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070518e35i001fl&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"16285","China","An accord on mining South Africa's rich uranium deposits and developing peaceful nuclear technology","2006","false","Guardian International PagesChinese premier boosts trade with seven-nation Africa tour: Booming economy spurs hunt for natural resources: Oil is chief interest but nuclear accord also likelyRory Carroll, Johannesburg923 words22 June 2006The GuardianGRDN19English© Copyright 2006. The Guardian. All rights reserved.China's economic and diplomatic push into Africa has gone into overdrive this week with a seven-country tour by its premier, Wen Jiabao, to secure trade deals.After warm welcomes in Egypt, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola, Mr Wen arrived in South Africa yesterday for two days of talks on nuclear power, textile imports and regional alliances. The visits form part of what Beijing foreign policy officials have dubbed the 'year of Africa', a drive for access to the continent's natural resources to fuel China's booming economy.Mr Wen was greeted at the Tuynhuys presidential office in Cape Town with a red carpet, two lines of cabinet ministers and a South African navy brass band. It was his fifth such ceremony in as many days, with two more later this week in Tanzania and Uganda.The pomp reflected a burgeoning influence in Africa, which is rapidly catching up with that of the United States and the old colonial powers, Britain and France. Mr Wen said China's relations with Africa were based on mutual benefit and posed no threat to US interests.China's trade with the continent reached a record $39.7bn (pounds 21.5bn) last year, almost four times the figure in 2001. As ubiquitous as Chinese technicians building roads and railways are Chinese-run shops and restaurants. Schools have started teaching Mandarin and direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai are proliferating.Mr Wen, the first Chinese premier to visit South Africa in half a century, was due to sign a pact on textiles to ease a trade imbalance blamed for the loss of 25,000 South African jobs, a touchy issue that has soured feelings towards Chinese immigrants. After talks with the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, the premier was due to meet oil executives and expatriate Chinese business leaders.An accord on mining South Africa's rich uranium deposits and developing peaceful nuclear technology, with both countries sharing French-designed reactors, was also expected.Further talks are scheduled for today to cover climate change, peacekeeping and the alleviation of poverty, a sign that China's engagement has broadened beyond a hunt for raw materials.The Asian giant signalled its ambitions in January by publishing an Africa policy paper, followed by a tour of three countries by the president, Hu Jintao. In November Beijing will host a China-Africa summit that is expected to attract about 40 heads of government and state.Mr Wen's tour is a showcase of Chinese deal-making. Accords in Egypt on oil, natural gas and telecommunications were followed by a $66m loan to Ghana for a telecommunications project and hints of $600m for a hydroelectric dam. Congo was offered economic, commercial and technical cooperation. Tanzania and Uganda are expecting fresh credit lines and infrastructure projects.There was no doubting the trip's chief interest: oil. With an economy that grew by 10.3% in the first quarter of this year, China's need is ravenous. Worried by Middle Eastern instability, it wants more oil from Africa, which already accounts for up to a third of its supply.Mr Wen's visit to Angola consolidated last month's $1.4bn deal between China's state-owned giant Sinopec and the host's state-owned oil producer, Sonangol, to develop new fields. Angola recently overtook Saudi Arabia as China's biggest oil supplier.Without giving details, a joint communique said China would extend more credit and expand technical assistance for Angola's postwar reconstruction.The president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, praised the lack of preconditions. 'We hail China's pragmatism towards Angola, which has allowed us to speed up the country's reconstruction.'Watchdog groups said that was a euphemism for China turning a blind eye to the Angolan government's corruption and human rights abuses. Similar criticism has been levelled at Beijing's dealings with Sudan and Zimbabwe.Chinese diplomats say it is a matter of respecting sovereignty. Privately they add that their approach is more honest than the west's, which chides some regimes but ignores allies' abuses.guardian.co.uk/china >Sunday 18 JuneEgyptCll: 5,493Exports to china as a % of total: 2.27% Signs agreements on energy and telecoms china also agrees to %50m loan provides $10m to build an investment centreMondayGhanaCll 5.034, extremeExports to China: 3% Commits to low-interest loan of $66m.

'Asignificant number of tour operators are switching their programmes fromother destinations to South Africa and certain operators are consideringcharter programmes for the first time. We have received very positivefeedback from the operators regarding future growth and have had manyenquiries for quotations for large numbers of passengers for both 2003 and.2004.'Ms Scott said that the USA and Asian markets were significantly affected bythe events of September 11, which resulted in passenger volumes remainingstatic for the six months from July to December. 'In spite of this decline,margins and the overall performance of the inbound division improved.Confirmed volumes for the next six months are heartening and all being well,this division should finish the year on a good note.'Following the terror attacks certain companies put an embargo on travellingoverseas for three months which caused a decline in outbound passengers, butMs Scott reports that the domestic corporate market is showing signs ofimprovement. In the past few moths there has been a substantial drop in thenumber of outbound leisure passengers which can be attributed to both.September 11 as well as the depreciation of the Rand.Ms Scott said that it is vital that South Africa extends the tourism seasonbeyond its current five months, as any marked increase in tourist volumeswill be impacted by the availability of airline seats and accommodation.'As a country we need to make a concerted and tourism-wide effort tosubstantially improve service standards if we want to entrench SouthAfrica's position as a high quality, affordable destination.'Tourvest's merchandise, duty free, outbound and financial services divisionwhich includes American Express Foreign Exchange is performing well.'The only division under pressure at the moment is the outbound division butwe are addressing this and are gaining new accounts through more aggressivemarketing and service.'According to Ms Scott, the European market, particularly the British market,will grow substantially. However, the market with the greatest potential isthe Chinese market, since the Chinese government has awarded South Africapreferred destination status. 'Although we anticipate the main benefits ofthis will be felt in the latter part of 2002, we are already experiencinglarge increases in numbers from China and other parts of Asia over theprevious year.'Ms Scott concluded that potential exists to grow revenues from all ofTourvest's businesses, particularly its retail and merchandising divisionwhich secures a large portion of its business from the internationaltourist. There is also potential revenue growth in both inbound and foreignexchange.

So with the two together, it is a very exciting situation,' said Hashatse.The China Central Television (CCTV) network serves more than one billion viewers, making it the largest television network in the world.Hashatse said the value of the deal was secondary to the benefits of cooperation. 'This represents the road to the friendship, but we will be able to assess the costs once production has begun,' he said. The agreements involve cooperation as well as content sharing.The first of these is the Beyond the Rainbow agreement to co-produce a large-scale musical and cultural performance of South African and Chinese artists and musicians. The show will be staged in South Africa in October.The second is to produce the Face of China, the Chinese version of M-Net's Face of Africa competition. MIH said the focus would be on 'discovering young beauties and encouraging authentic and modern Chinese fashion design', with the aim of broadcasting this beyond China's borders.The third agreement involves children's television programming and will culminate in a series of six episodes for each country, being filmed, broadcast and distributed initially in China, Asia, South Africaand the rest of Africa.In terms of the first agreement between MIH and CCTV, signed in 1997, the broadcaster's international channel, CCTV 4, is broadcast on DStv to Chinese audiences in Africa and Europe.The latest agreements were signed yesterday by MIH Holdings CEO Cobus Stofberg and CCTV president Zhao Hua Yong.CCTV broadcasts on eight channels, plus one English channel, and produces 62 per cent of its own content. It maintains regular contact with 273 television organizations in 140 countries.MIH Holdings, which owns Nasdaq-and Amsterdam-listed MIH Limited, consists of television platforms including M-Net, Supersport and Multichoice Africa, technology businesses including OpenTV and Mindport, and global internet applications through M-Web.Source: `Business Day' web site, Johannesburg, in English 1 Aug 00.Document bbcmm00020010804dw84001rn","Other (see notes)","Television, Media","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","South Africa","http://oscar.itpir.wm.edu/mbdc/create.php

"16178","China","Comprehensive Local Textile Adjustment Package","2006","false","Mail and Guardian619 words4 September 2006ISI Emerging Markets AfricawireLQAFEnglish© Copyright 2006. Internet Securities, Inc. All rights reserved.An agreement to limit Chinese clothing and textile imports has brought mixed reaction, with labour in the textile industry welcoming the opportunity to rebuild the industry and the Democratic Alliance (DA) saying it will bring price increases.The opposition party said it will ask the minister of trade and industry whether concerns of the clothing and textile retail industry were considered, as well as the implications for consumers and employment.The South African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (Sactwu) said on Monday that 55Â 000 new jobs could be created.'We need to use the space created to ensure we make our factories state-of-the-art and improve training of workers on a scale that will develop South Africa into a world-class producer,' said general secretary Ebrahim Patel.'Over the past four years, the local fashion-manufacturing industry has lost approximately 67Â 000 jobs, largely as a result of a surge of imports from China,' said Patel. 'Over the same period, the five big retailers have recorded R18,1-billion in pre-tax profits. It is now time for retailers to work with the local manufacturing industry to place the country and employment before profits.'He said the vast volumes of imports from China have had a devastating impact, with factory closures in the poorest parts of the country such as Dimbaza in the Eastern Cape, which have become industrial ghost towns.'Even the United States, the European Union and Brazil had quotas imposed on Chinese imports, even though they had not yet been as adversely affected by imports as those in South Africa.'Since 2002, clothing imports from China rose by 480%. At the end of last year, our trade balance with China was R23-billion, meaning that South Africa had a negative trade of R23-billion.'Opposition On the other hand, the DA said 'firing off trade restriction like buckshot' could lead to price increases of 20% to 25% as well as stock shortages over the coming festive season, according to industry analysts.DA trade and industry spokesperson Pierre Rabie suggested a targeted approach that makes assertive use of the more positive options provided by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework.Recommendations include, firstly, obtaining a commitment from China to assist in supporting South Africa's local textiles and clothing firms through comprehensive adjustment packages. These packages should facilitate restructuring and reorientation of firms to identify and service niche markets successfully, said Rabie.'This would certainly signify a willingness to encourage the involvement of the Chinese in our economy.'Secondly, the government should clearly assert its willingness to invoke WTO safeguards against dumping if it is necessary. 'It should also explore the possibility with China of setting a minimum value on items of clothing that may be exported here without restraint.'Thirdly, together with China, the government should investigate the WTO-sanctioned option of limiting the extent to which China may increase its annual exports to South Africa to no more than 7,5%.The China-South African agreement follows more than a year's negotiations and was first initialled in June by visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and President Thabo Mbeki.It sets quantitative targets on specified clothing and textile products and will be effective from next month to the end of 2008. -- SapaRelated articlesWoolworths criticises clothing quotas Blogs linking to M G Online | Blogs linking to this articleSave this page on del.icio.us | What is del.icio.us?Add M G Online news to your website or blogGet M G Online news in your RSS readerFor more news, go to the M G Online home pageDocument LQAF000020060905e29400007","Manufacturing and Industry","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","South Africa","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LQAF000020060905e29400007&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved. No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.Text of report entitled: 'Wen Jiabao 22 June meets in Cape Town with South African Vice-President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and Firmino Mucavele, chief executive of the Secretariat of the 'New Partnership for Africa's Development'', carried by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)Cape Town, 22 June: On 22 June, State Council Premier Wen Jiabao met in Cape Town respectively with South African Vice-President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and Firmino Mucavele, chief executive of the 'New Partnership for Africa's Development'.Wen Jiabao told Mlambo-Ngcuka: My visit to South Africa has been highly successful. An extensive consensus has been reached between President Thabo Mbeki and myself on promoting cooperation between China and South Africa; and a series of important agreements, including the 'Programme of Cooperation on Deepening the Strategic Partnership Between China and South Africa', have been signed between the two sides. China and South Africa have been promoting bilateral relations in adherence to the principle of mutual trust, equality, and mutual benefit; and relations between the two countries enjoy a solid foundation as a result. I believe that along with the all-round implementation of the 'Programme', relations between China and South Africa will surely undergo further consolidation and development.Wen Jiabao indicated: China and South Africa are partners in seeking common growth. The Chinese side supports the 'Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa' that aims at promoting economic and social development, and is willing to provide assistance for the South side in the area of human resources development.Mlambo-Ngcuka said: The South African side is happy about the major accomplishments achieved during Premier Wen Jiabao's visit in South Africa; and believes that the documents signed between the two sides, including the 'Programme of Cooperation on Deepening the Strategic Partnership Between China and South Africa', have opened up a broad prospect in the future cooperation between the two countries. The implementation of the 'Programme' will provide impetus for the 'Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa', and this embodies China's support and assistance for the development of a new South Africa. The South African side expresses appreciation and gratitude for this, and is willing to cooperate with China in a number of prioritized fields, such as infrastructural construction, mineral products, and human resources development.During his meeting with Mucavele, Wen Jiabao indicated: The Chinese side has regards its cooperation with the 'New Partnership for Africa's Development' as an important content in China-Africa friendly cooperation. Ever since the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000, the Chinese side has adopted a series of pragmatic cooperative measures towards Africa, including granting tax and tariff exemptions and stepping up personnel training; and has increased its aid to Africa, and has carried out cooperation with African nations in diversified forms in the prioritized fields under the 'New Partnership for Africa's Development', including infrastructural construction, aid-the-poor programme, prevention and control of contagious diseases, human resources development, and agriculture. There have been huge potentials for cooperation between the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the 'New Partnership for Africa's Development', as the two share the same goal of promoting mutually beneficial cooperation and promoting common development while the prioritized fields set by the two also coincide with each other. With a view to promoting the pragmatic cooperation between the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the 'New Partnership for Africa's Development', I hope that the two sides will step up contacts and coordination, and establish a long-acting cooperation mechanism. The Chinese side will, through bilateral and multilateral channels, extend greater support towards the prioritized fields under the 'New Partnership for Africa's Development'.Mucavele thanked China for assigning great importance to Africa and for extending support to the 'New Partnership for Africa's Development'. He indicated that African nations looked forward to stepping up cooperation with China and hoped that China would continue to follow Africa's development with close interest and would become a partner to Africa in the latter's efforts to extricate itself from poverty and realize development.Source: Xinhua news agency domestic service, Beijing, in Chinese 1534 gmt 22 Jun 06a4a06223Document BBCAPP0020060623e26n000pd","Multisector","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","South Africa","http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=BBCAPP0020060623e26n000pd&cat=a&ep=ASI

The two countries will 'explore ways to enhance capacity building in mining, construction and other industries' according to the communique, issued during a visit to the Chinese capital by South African Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.   In June, Beijing launched the $5 billion China-Africa Development Fund, with initial capital of $1 billion, to help finance Chinese investments in Africa, part of Beijing's pledge to double its aid to the continent.   Beijing is increasingly using its massive foreign reserves to lend to Africa, paving the way for its state-owned firms to bid on mining and infrastructure projects as it tries to secure raw materials supply for its booming economy.   The countries also agreed to expand exchanges and cooperation in a variety of fields, particularly aquaculture and agricultural products. China increased the number of scholarships offered to South African students.

"17301","China","Kayole Hospital (Duplicate)","2009","false","NAIROBI, Kenya, Jun 30 – The construction of a Sh544 million Nairobi East District Hospital is due to be completed by August next year, authorities said on Tuesday.Speaking during the groundbreaking of the facility in Kayole, Acting Chinese Ambassador Zhou Pingjian said Sh117 million will go into equipping the facility which is being constructed with his government’s support.He said despite the economic crisis, the Chinese government remained committed to honour its pledges.“Everybody nowadays is taking about what effect the global financial meltdown will have on the donor community, and they ask us how we will meet our projects. We just tell then that china will not back down on our commitments”Medical Services Minister Anyang Nyong’o said the ministry plans to rehabilitate some 23 district and sub-district hospitals and two provincial hospitals in the country.“We have realised that over the last 20 years, we have not had very good investment in our hospitals. To improve equipment, infrastructure and provide adequate personnel,” said Prof Nyong’o.The Minister said it’s incumbent on the government to ensure affordable and accessible healthcare to Kenyans as they all pay their taxes to facilitate service delivery.Prof Nyong’o said the ministry was working on reforms in the healthcare sector that would reduce key issues such as high maternal and child morbidity and mortality, malaria, tuberculosis, as well as HIV and AIDS.“We cannot continue to recite endlessly; so many people are living below the poverty line so many people are dying every day that’s not a very good profession.”He said the facility will ease pressure on Kenyatta National Hospital and improve the delivery of health services adding that the ministry aims to turn all provincial hospitals into referral facilities in the next three years.“When this facility is done accessibility won’t be the issue, because since we are working on a comprehensive social health insurance scheme, affordability will not be the issue. Because with an insurance scheme which covers all by 2017, both in and out patient, we are sure that the urban poor will not worry to access this facility.”Prof Nyong’o said this will release some resources and energies at both KNH and Moi University hospitals to concentrate on research, teaching and handling of only special cases.---------Engineers work at the construction site of the Kayole hospital in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, June 4, 2010.

Zimbabwe's state-controlled radio network announced the purchase of six fighters from China. The aircraft were purchased 'to deal with any challenges,' according to Zimbabwe state radio. New air-to-air missiles are expected to be part of this arms package.Where Zimbabwe got the money to purchase these aircraft when hundreds of thousands of its citizens are going hungry is unknown. A report by the South African Mail and Guardian newspaper estimated the cost of each aircraft at about $20 million.Giles Mutsekwa believes the aircraft were purchased to reward the Zimbabwe military and maintain its support for President Robert Mugabe's regime. Mutsekwa is the shadow Minister of Defense for Movement for Democratic Change, Zimbabwe's main opposition party. Mugabe has been repeatedly criticized for trying to turn Zimbabwe into a one-party state with himself as president-for-life.The aircraft being provided to Zimbabwe appear to be K-8 trainers, a Chinese copy of the British Hawk. Hawks were provided to Zimbabwe by the United Kingdom in 1980. British Prime Minister Tony Blair placed an embargo on spare parts for these aircraft in 2000. A few years ago, Zimbabwe acquired three used MiG-23 fighters from Libya.Document FORCST0020050415e14e0000a","Military","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=FORCST0020050415e14e0000a&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

But they now need equipment and the necessary capital to capacitate them. We need investment in agriculture, the sub-sectors mainly tobacco, cotton, maize, livestock and horticulture,' President Mugabe said.The President said through increased co-operation, Zimbabwe needed beneficiation of its products to realise maximum value.He said Zimbabwe is endowed with natural resources but their exploitation was being hindered by poor infrastructure such as bad roads.'We need some expansion that requires capital investment, irrigation schemes must be improved, we have a number of rivers, a criss-cross of rivers large and small but since we are a tropical country, we receive rains once a year and water goes,' he said.He said while Zimbabwe was more industrialised than some average African countries, more still needed to be done to improve the manufacturing sector.Turning to the diplomatic relations between Zimbabwe and China, the President said Harare would continue to strengthen ties with its allies and ignore Western countries that sought to unjustifiably vilify it.'They imposed sanctions on us and travel bans. I have no appetite for America, but I have an appetite for my country and my friends like China,' he said.He scoffed at the decision by the United States administration to place him and the First Lady Amai Grace Mugabe on the list of individuals believed to have funded terrorists.President Mugabe said former US president George W. Bush should instead be regarded as a terrorist for causing the death of former Iraq leader Saddam Hussein under the pretext that he harboured weapons of mass destruction.'There are people in Washington who think they have the divine right to judge on people. To say these are the good people of the world, these are the bad people, to say Zimbabwe is on the axis of evil together with Cuba, that is Bush acting as God,' he said.'We will stand by what is right even if we are to fall. Mao (Zedong) taught us to stand by that which is right, principles.'In his response, Mr Jiang hailed Zim-China bilateral relations saying Harare had remained resolute in pursuit of democracy.'Zimbabwe has got great respect because of its history in fighting colonialism,' he said.Mr Jiang said China had continued to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Zimbabwe, particularly in engineering.He said negotiations were underway between Zimbabwe and Chinese companies for joint ventures in the tobacco and cotton indus-tries, among others.'In the near future, Exim Bank (the Export-Import Bank of China) will send a delegation to Zimbabwe for discussions on investment. We also need to deepen co-operation on mining, (and) tourism,' he said.In his speech at the official opening of the Joint Commission, Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi outlined the support Zimbabwe had received from China.This includes the US$200 million Buyer's Credit Facility extended by China's Exim Bank to procure agricultural equipment.The bank also extended a US$60 million concessionary loan to Farmers' World to buy more farming implements.'The payment of the arrears and extension of the repayment period on the US$200 million Buyer's CreditLoan have paved the way for increased co-operation between Zimbabwe and China,' he said.Zimbabwe had also benefited from the eight measures announced by Chinese President Hu Jintao, whose implementation has seen the construction of two primary schools in Bindura and Warren Park, the Agricultural Demonstration Centre at Gwebi College and the state-of-the-art Sino-Zimbabwe Friendship Hospital in Mahusekwa.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020100708e678000uu","Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","","310","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020100708e678000uu&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"22014","China","Chinese businessman supplying ZANU-PF directly with money- not a project","2011","false","Zanu PF Propped Up By Controversial Chinese Businessmanby Alex Bell730 words14 March 201105:06 PMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2011 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedMar 14, 2011 (SW Radio Africa/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- ZANU PF is reportedly being propped up by a controversial Chinese businessman, who has been supplying the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) with the means to keep Robert Mugabe in power.According to South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, elusive business magnate Sam Pa and CIO chief Happyton Bonyongwe have struck a deal, which sees Pa financing 'a covert operation whose purpose is to sustain President Robert Mugabe's regime.'The newspaper quotes 'disillusioned intelligence officers and party officials,' who are said to be 'unhappy' about how Zimbabwe's natural resources are being traded for 'personal and electoral gain.'These sources allege that in return for Zimbabwe's diamonds and other mineral resources, Pa has provided funds and equipment to the CIO to enable it to deliver ZANU PF an electoral victory.The money is reportedly being used to train and deploy militias who are harassing and intimidating Zimbabweans across the country. It is also understood that Pa has provided the technology to rig election outcomes in ZANU PF's favour, a tool the party has repeatedly used to 'win' previous elections.The Sunday Times reports that Pa is also responsible for personally providing the CIO with fleets of cars and, in early 2010, he offered to match the salaries of the entire staff of the CIO, the police and the armed forces to ensure their loyalty to ZANU PF.Bonyongwe meanwhile stands accused of keeping this relationship well oiled, after 'negotiating' Pa's involvement in the Chiadzwa diamond fields.Pa is said to be behind the creation of the joint-venture Sino Zim Development, which was recently granted a licence to mine at Chiadzwa. The sources told the Sunday Times that using different aliases, Pa had flown out of Harare and military airbases last year with about 60 000 carats of high quality diamonds and 69kg of the industrial kind. Quoting 'renegade CIO sources,' the Sunday Times said that Pa himself 'is part of the grand plan to use (Chiadzwa) diamonds to prop up the regime.'The business magnate, described as 'elusive' and 'canny', is reported to have made similar arrangements in other African countries. Oil-rich Angola is described by the Sunday times as 'a prime example.' Pa has also invested heavily in mineral-rich Guinea and Tanzania, while Madagascar has also been linked to the Hong Kong based businessman.Political analyst Professor John Makumbe told SW Radio Africa that ZANU PF's involvement with such a character is not surprising.'It is typical of ZANU PF to be linked to the likes of Sam Pa, people who are involved in shady business deals, people who deliberately avoid transparency,' Makumbe said.China's influence in Zimbabwe is strengthening all the time, and it is understood that the Development Bank of China is planning US$10-billion worth of investments in Zimbabwe over the next five years.Last week, Chinese merchant Sinotex announced a US$500-million cotton production deal, set to benefit the ZANU PF beneficiaries of Robert Mugabe's land grab. At the same time, Zimbabwe's biggest tobacco buyer is a Chinese firm, Tian Ze, while the Chinese agribusiness Beidahuang Group is said to be negotiating for Zimbabwe's cane and forestry estates. The China National Nuclear Corporation is also said to be prospecting for uranium in Zimbabwe.The groups are all set to be exempt from ZANU PF's indiginisation plans, with tobacco firm Tian Ze already confirmed to be spared from handing over 51% ownership to Zimbabweans. South Africa's Mail   Guardian newspaper recently asked ZANU PF's Empowerment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere how companies qualify for such exemptions, and he said: 'We look at their disposition towards our people.'Makumbe said that ZANU PF will make every effort to maintain its relationship with the Chinese, not only because the country is one of Mugabe's key supporters on the United Nations Security Council. China has used its position as a permanent member of the Security Council to block any action against the ZANU PF regime.'It is a mutually beneficial arrangement, especially because ZANU PF is desperate for survival. They won't win an election without electoral rigging and they need people like Sam Pa to make that happen,' Makumbe said.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020110314e73e0020j","Government and Social Services","","","Implementation","2","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Tied","4","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020110314e73e0020j&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"22413","China","Diamond mining certificates in Zimbabwe granted to Chinese company Sino-Zimbabwe (Duplicate 22479)","2010","false","Three New Diamond Miners Licensedby Martin Kadzere392 words9 November 201012:12 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2010 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedHarare, Nov 09, 2010 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- GOVERNMENT has licensed three more diamond investors to extract the gems in Chiadzwa, a senior official has said.Economic Planning and Investment Promotion Minister Tapiwa Mashakada told a pre-budget seminar in Victoria Falls last week that the licences were granted to Sino-Zimbabwe, a joint commercial entity between the Chinese government and Zimbabwe with business interests in various sectors.Another Chinese company Anjil and Pure Diamonds were also given concession in Chiadzwa diamond fields, said the minister.Mbada Diamonds and Canadile Mining were the only two companies mining in Chiadzwa in partnership with State-owned Zimbabwe Mining Development Mining Corporation.Government, however, pulled out of the Canadile joint venture amid allegations that key shareholders of its partners, Core Mining, could have been involved in blood diamond deals.'We now have five mining companies operating in Chiadzwa diamond field,' said Minister Mashakada, stressing the need for accountability so that Zimbabweans can fully benefit from diamond revenues.Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai had earlier told the same meeting that revenue from diamonds sales has not meaningfully contributed to the fiscus.'There were high expectations, but let me tell you that Chiadzwa diamonds have not produced 'eldorado',' said Prime Minister Tsvangirai.After the first batch of the diamonds stockpile was auctioned and raked in only US$56 million when many people had expected over a billion United States dollars, the belief that Chiadzwa was a treasure trove suffered considerably.At some point there was strong belief that the diamond sector could be the panacea to Zimbabwe's liquidity constraints, which have constrained economic recovery as capital challenges choked projects key to rebuilding the economy.Mbada and Canadile started operations in Chiadzwa late last year and auctioned the first batch of the gems in August this year.Experts say Zimbabwe could become the world largest producer of diamonds by 2013, with an expected volume of 40 million carats per year to be produced from the rich deposits in Chiadzwa.The export of 40 million carats provides annual revenue of about US$2 billion.Zimbabwe's mining sector, which needs at least US$5 billion to restore viability, is expected to grow by 44 percent next year on the strong performance of diamonds, platinum gold and nickel.All Africa Global MediaDocument

Chinese Firm at Chiadzwaby Indiana Chirara331 words14 March 201108:49 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2011 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedMar 14, 2011 (Zimbabwe Standard/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) has given another Chinese company a licence to mine diamonds in the controversial Chiadzwa area, a senior ZMDC official has said.Godwills Masimirembwa, the ZMDC chairman told Standardbusiness in an interview last week that Sino-Zimbabwe had joined Anjin, another Chinese company already in Chiadzwa prospecting for diamonds.A third company, Pure Dian from the United Arab Emirates, was also granted a license to join Mbada and Marange Resources, which already run mines in the area in partnership with the ZMDC.'Currently there are only two companies which are mining, that is Mbada and Marange,' he said.'The other three, which are Sino-Zimbabwe, Anjin and Pure Dian, are carrying out exploration though they have the licenses.'Masimirembwa said the ZMDC continued to receive a flurry of applications from both local and foreigninvestors who wanted licences to start mining operations in Chiadzwa.'We have more than 150 applications for mining licences from potential investors and this shows that as Zimbabwe, we have the resources and we have the capability of growing economically,' he said.'Financial and technical capacity are some of the conditions that determine the approval of a mining licence but it's not an easy road.'Masimirembwa said under normal circumstances, the sale of diamonds from Chiadzwa could rake in US$85 million a month but only US$20 million was being realised because of sanctions.'The production of diamonds is under very difficult circumstances and the sale of the mineral is at a very slow pace, which is not good for the economy,' he said.ZMDC is currently under pressure to account for proceeds from diamond sales after Finance minister Tendai Biti indicated that most of the money was not reaching government coffers.Masimirembwa and Zanu PF symphathisers have in turn accused Biti of trying to expose how Zimbabwe evades Western sanctions.All Africa Global

to Probe Sino-Zim Move318 words16 May 201111:15 PMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2011 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedMay 16, 2011 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation says it will send a team to investigate circumstances surrounding the recent temporary suspension of operations by Sino-Zimbabwe at the Chiadzwa diamonds fields.Sino-Zimbabwe laid off most of its workers amid concerns that its mining claims in the diamond area may not hold enough alluvial diamonds to operate a viable mine.ZMDC chairman, Mr Godwills Masimirembwa, at the weekend, said the parastatal was never informed on the development.Sino-Zimbabwe is a joint venture between China and the Government of Zimbabwe through the ZMDC.'We were not formally advised as the ZMDC and we do not have full details. We are sending a team to carry out a review at Sino-Zimbabwe,' Mr Masimirembwa said.'As far as we are concerned, they (Sino-Zimbabwe) are still on the ground.'Mr Masimirembwa said diamond production at Chiadzwa had not gone down but the problem was that companies mining the gems were unable to sell them on the international market freely.'The diamond resource is significant and claims to the contrary are totally untrue. What we, as ZMDC and the Government of Zimbabwe, are crying for is permission to sell our diamonds. If companies are not allowed to sell diamonds, it affects production and at the moment companies are finding it difficult because of the US policy on us. That is the real issue,' Mr Masimirembwa said.The US is leading a campaign to stop Zimbabwe from selling its diamonds on the international market citing unfounded human rights abuses.This is despite the fact that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme recently gave the country the green light to trade in its gems.Sino-Zimbabwe, alongside Mbada Diamonds, Marange Resources, Pure Diamonds and Anjin are the five companies licensed to mine diamonds at the Chiadzwa diamonds fields.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020110517e75h0001u","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Suspended","4","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020110314e73e00117&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Cameroonian President Paul Biya commented on the deals. It appears that the grant  funded projects of the government of Cameroon's choosing, which according to sources, 'included wireless (CDMA) phone technology for CAMTEL (developed by Huawei Technologies), a potable water project for Douala (#315, and several small agricultural projects.' The extent to which this money funded these projects (or whether it did at all) is currently unclear, as well as the specifics of each project. This appears to be an ideal project to follow up on with in-country contacts. The project is likely linked to #11939, a 2007 preferential loan for telecommunications projects.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","220","Pipeline/identification","1","Grant (excluding debt forgiveness)","Unset","","Cameroon","http://www.dibussi.com/2010/12/wikileaks-chinas-growing-presence-in-cameroon.html

"540","China","Oil rig production (Duplicate)","2006","false","'(c) 2006 Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive LLC, trading as Factiva  CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian-Chinese company will start producing oil rigs in Egypt next year, the Egyptian Oil Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.' 'China and Egypt have agreed to three new memoranda of understanding (MoU) on energy-sector co-operation. The first of these concerns the establishment of a joint rig manufacturing company, which would manufacture three rigs in 2007 and a further seven in 2008, reaching a total of 20 rigs by 2010. The second agreement concerns the involvement of China's Chinook company for oil exploration in Egyptian acreage. The company would also work with Egyptian companies, including Enppi and Petrojet, on projects in other African states. The third agreement concerns drilling by Sinopec, both inside and outside Egypt.Significance: Chinese oil companies have been relatively slow off the mark in Egypt, compared with other African states, although the last year has seen a more significant 'push' for new investment. This has seen the state start-up Tharwa form a drilling venture with Sinopec, possibly the same agreement referred to in the third MoU (see Egypt: 7 July 2006: ).The Chinese-Egypt MoU is notable for the technical aspects of the projects under consideration, with Egypt very much keen to extract the maximum benefits from state-backed investors, in terms of boosting domestic technical capacity and realising employment opportunities. Strong interest from other international players has strengthened Egypt's hand in this regard.' ' 埃及和中国签订了三份石油和天然气合作协议，将在2007年前共建3所石油钻塔。    综合外电10月23日报道，埃及和中国签订了三份石油和天然气合作协议，其中主要合作方式为建立石油钻塔。    《生活日报》（Al-Hayat）22日的报道称，埃及石油部长法赫米（Sameh Fahmy）与中国石油化工股份有限公司（China Petroleum   Chemical Corp., 或称Sinopec, 简称：中石化）签订了一份协议，将创建一家埃及和中国合资的搭建石油钻塔的专业公司。    这所名为中石化--塔尔（Sino-Tharwa）的公司将在2007年前搭建3所石油钻塔，在2008年前搭建另外7所钻塔，并计划提高产量以在2010年前搭建20所钻塔。    该报援引自法赫米的报道称，鉴于对钻塔需求的增长和租赁钻塔成本增加，这些钻塔将有助于推进埃及的开采活动。    第二份协议是在法赫米近期访问中国期间签订的，旨在国际竞标方面进行合作。    第三份协议是同中石化签订的，内容为增加中石化在埃及的活动，并在两年内将石油钻塔由2所增加至7所。（责任编辑：郭彩萍）'","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Egypt","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=RTEN000020061019e2aj00001&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Chinese President Hu Jintao has put forward proposals for developing sustainable relationship between China and Gabon. The Chinese leader held talks Wednesday in Beijing with visiting Gabonese President El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba. He said China is ready to work with Gabon to maintain the good momentum of the development of bilateral relations. In order to promote these relations, Hu proposed that the two countries push forward political communications and people-to-people exchanges, saying the two sides should further exchange mutual understanding and friendship so as to lay a solid foundation for the long-term development of bilateral relations. Secondly, President Hu said the two countries should further tap into the potential of trade and economic cooperation and expand the scale of cooperation. He said China will continue to encourage strong and prestigious Chinese enterprises to invest and do business in Gabon. He hoped the two sides will reinforce cooperation in such resources development areas as oil, mining and reforestation. Also he hoped that both sides explore such cooperative areas as agriculture, water conservation and fishing. Thirdly, President Hu said the two countries should deepen exchanges and cooperation in such fields as education, culture and public health; and step up collaboration in human resources development under the framework of the China-Africa Forum. Finally, Hu insisted that the two countries should give a bigger role to the political consultation mechanism between their foreign ministries so as to maintain sound cooperation and coordination on international affairs. President Bongo agreed with Hu on his comments on bilateral relations. He reiterated Gabon's stance on firmly sticking to the one-China policy and its support to China's cause of reunification. President Bongo briefed Hu about the current situation of Africa and the existing hot issues. Noting that China is a true friend of Africa, he said Gabon and other African states wish to deepen cooperation with China and hope that China will play a bigger role in resolving the hot issues in Africa. After the talks, the two presidents attended the signing ceremony of some documents between their governments, including the agreement on economic, technological cooperation and an aid package of $ 5 million (about CFA 2.7 billion) granted by Beijing for for development projects in Gabon.

It has also in recent years been turned into a drug trafficking hub by South American barons targetting European markets.","Government and Social Services","","","Completion","3","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Guinea-Bissau","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFPR000020101110e6ba007hq&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)Geneva, 12th December: China supports the international treaty that bans and restricts the use of inhumane conventional weapons and is encouraging more countries to accept it, a senior Chinese disarmament official said on Monday [11th December].At the Second Annual Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Amended Protocol II, the head of the Chinese delegation, Sha Zukang, brought up the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.'The Chinese delegation has noted that, since the last annual conference, the number of countries that have acceded to the amended protocol has increased from 45 to 58,' said Sha. 'This shows that more and more countries attach importance to the protocol, which is the first international legal instrument to address this issue of humanitarian concern. Now, almost all major land mine producing and using countries have acceded to the protocol.'However, Sha said 58 states are too few. 'Lack of universality will undercut the protocol's significance,' he stressed. 'And no matter how perfect an international legal instrument is, its influence and effectiveness will be limited in the absence of universal participation.'He urged the states to follow the protocol in earnest.Sha announced that the Chinese delegation is strongly opposed to any proposal for further amending the protocol at the current stage.However, he said, states may on a voluntary basis take the lead in implementing technical specifications as outlined in the proposed amendments and provide gratuitous technical assistance, equipment and training to developing countries.On humanitarian de-mining, Sha said that the Chinese government is continuing to cooperate with the Mine Action Service of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations by co-sponsoring another training workshop on de-mining technology from May to June this year, with trainees from Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Rwanda.The Chinese government is pressing rapidly ahead with its donations of de-mining equipment to Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Namibia, he added.'We hope this conference will strengthen exchanges and cooperation on de-mining technologies for reducing and ultimately doing away with land mines Sha said [as received].He emphasized that the Chinese government stands ready to cooperate and exchange with interested countries and inter-organizations in the field of humanitarian de-mining assistance and that China is also willing to join other states and explore ways to streamline the de-mining process.Source: Xinhua news agency, Beijing, in English 1308 gmt 12 Dec 00.Document bbcapp0020010804dwcc007hc","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","In-kind contribution","Partially tied","3","Africa, regional, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=bbcapp0020010804dwcc007hc&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

'Ethiopia has actively participated in the affairs of the FOCAC and played an important role in implementing the follow-up actions of the forum and in preparing for this summit,' Hu said. Meles, whose country co-chairs the forum, said the two countries share common aspirations for developing friendly bilateral cooperation as the exchanges between governments and peoples get closer. Meles expressed his appreciation for Hu's announcement of eight aid measures for Africa, vowing to make continued efforts to promote a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership. At the opening ceremony of the two-day summit, President Hu announced a package of major assistance, investment, trade and other key cooperation projects with Africa in an effort to strengthen China-Africa cooperation in more areas and at a higher level. In the eight-step package, China will double its 2006 assistance to Africa by 2009 and will provide 3 billion U.S. dollars of preferential loans and 2 billion U.S. dollars of preferential buyer's credits to Africa in the coming three years. China will also cancel debts in the form of all the interest- free government loans that matured at the end of 2005 owed by the heavily indebted poor countries and the least developed countries in Africa that have diplomatic relations with China. Oer the next three years, China will train 15,000 African professionals, Hu said. While addressing the opening ceremony of the summit, Meles said the China-Africa partnership forged 50 years ago must be renewed to address immediate challenges of fighting poverty and backwardness and seeking economic independence. Meles said African and Chinese economies are highly complementary. 'Africa provides to the growing Chinese economy a reliable field for investment, trade and the utilization of natural resources for mutual benefit. China provides for Africa a source of successful development experience, technology transfer, trade and investment.' The prime minister said the African people had 'ery high expectations' from the renewed Sino-African strategic partnership and 'welcomed' China's tremendous progress in the economic and other fields. Hu, 41 heads of state or government and senior officials of 48 African countries that have diplomatic ties with China, as well as representatives from regional and international organizations, attended the milestone gathering highlighting 'friendship, peace, cooperation and development'.

"943","China","Telecommunications equipment donation (Duplicate)","2005","false","'Chinese producers of electronic home appliances, agricultural machinery and small machinery are investing in Kenya with an eye on the greater EA market.A HIGH POWERED KENYAN trade delegation led by Finance Minister David Mwiraria was set to leave for Beijing, China on March 19, courtesy of the Chinese embassy in Kenya.The trip marks the end of the five-year tour of duty of Zhu Xiaochuan, China's economic and commercial counsellor to Kenya, whose tenure has seen an unprecedented influx of Chinese businesses, including state-owned firms, into the country.In the past two years alone, over 50 Chinese investors have pitched tent here. Among them are Jiangsu International Economic and Technological Co-operation Co, Sichuan International Economic and Technological Co-operation Co Ltd and China Road Bridge Construction (Group) Corporation and China Import and Export (Group) Corporation for Complete Sets of Equipment.The coming of Chinese firms into Kenya, says Mr Xiaochuan is very much by design. 'China is positioning itself to capture the greater regional market and Kenya with its superior infrastructure and internal and external trade policies that conform to international standards is our gateway,' he told TheEastAfrican last week. He further said that China regards Kenya as an important partner and is striving to promote economic co-operation by encouraging more Chinese companies to not only export their products to Kenya but also invest here.TWO CHINESE FIRMS based in Nairobi's Industrial Area - Content High Tech Corporation, a manufacturer of coloured televisions, and Khorasan Trading Company, a dry cell manufacturer - are already selling the bulk of their products in the regional market. 'The two companies sell 80 per cent of their products as far afield as the Democratic Republic of Congo,' said Mr Xiaochuan. China, he added has been encouraging enterprises, especially in the assembling and production of electronic home appliances, agricultural machinery and small machinery and electronic products, to invest in Kenya.Mr Xiaochuan is proud of the fact that the Chinese embassy in Kenya has built a $3 million ultra-modern China Trade Centre on Ngong Road, in Nairobi, where Chinese firms and individuals exhibit and sell their products. 'This is the biggest shopping window of Chinese products in the region,' he said. The largest tenant at the centre is Horizon Iato supermarket, which is one of China's four large-scale supermarket chain with a presence in Madagascar, Togo and Mozambique.Mr Xiaochuan says that the chain store was designed to promote the exports of Chinese commodities and boost bilateral economic and commercial contact between China and Africa.Last month, Telkom Kenya received communication equipment worth Ksh144 million ($1.9 million) from China's largest listed communications firm, Zhongxin Telecommunication Equipment Communications (ZTE). The 'gift' will help Telkom Kenya to expand its services countrywide. ZTE Communications in a joint initiative with Telkom Kenya has launched a digital exchange in Thika, north of Nairobi, which has a 4,000 fixed-line capacity. The exchange will increase Thika's telephone capacity from the current 5,300 to 9,300, expandable on demand.However, some experts warn that gifts from the East are not always what they seem. 'Indeed, many African countries have welcomed the countries from the East because they see them as a means of reducing dependence on the West, especially the US and the UK,' says Dr Zephania Ong'ata, programme director, East Africa Centre for Economic Policy Analysis, a regional research institute on macroeconomic policy, inequality poverty and globalisation.Donated equipment demands that it installed and maintained by the donor and also creates a market for the donor's products. Dr Ongata is urging Kenya and other African countries to look the gift horse in the mouth.CHINESE CUSTOMS figures show that China-Kenya trade increased by 34.4 per cent year-on-year in the first seven months of 2003, to $127 million, and China's imports from Kenya nearly doubled year-on-year.By June 2003, Chinese enterprises' investment in Kenya amounted to $22.8 million.Since the 2000 China-Africa Co-operation Forum, the Chinese government has allocated special funds to support Chinese enterprises to make investments in Africa and carry out co-operative projects for mutual benefit.Dr Ong'ata points out that many of these projects are 'sweeteners,' designed to clinch not just the contract at hand, but others down the line.Trade volumes between China and Africa rose 53.9 per cent year-on-year to $20.5 billion in the first nine months of last year, according to the Chinese government.This includes a 33.2 per cent increase in exports to Africa and a 78 per cent increase in exports from Africa to China. While a proportion of this is made up of manufactured goods from South Africa, it includes crude oil and unprocessed agricultural goods from other African countries - which simply replicates the traditional trading relationships with Western countries that are so often criticised by Africa.'

"959","China","road- and school-construction aid (Not project level)","2007","true","(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones   Company, Inc.) BEIJING -- An attack that killed nine Chinese oil workers in Ethiopia's desolate Ogaden Desert has provided a bloody reminder that China's world-wide pursuit of raw materials has taken it into some rough neighborhoods -- and that goodwill proclamations may not be enough to avoid getting caught up in local conflicts. Exposure to the military and political struggles that convulse Africa is one of the prices this fast-developing country is paying for its growing power and profile on the world stage. It is a new sensation for most Chinese, who are used to considering their country an economic actor that, unlike traditional powers, avoids interference in the domestic affairs of other nations. The nine Chinese were among 74 people reported killed shortly after dawn Tuesday in the desert of eastern Ethiopia. In addition, Chinese authorities said, seven Chinese oil technicians were kidnapped by the ethnic-Somali rebels who launched the raid. [But the group said it is only holding six Chinese workers, according to an Associated Press report on Thursday.] The captives joined a growing list. Already this year, 16 Chinese oil workers have been kidnapped in Nigeria and a Chinese engineer was killed and another injured in Kenya. The questions facing Chinese President Hu Jintao's government are twofold: how to better protect the four million Chinese working abroad and how to preserve the growing value of Chinese investments in places such as Ethiopia, where governments face instability. [On Thursday, China said it won't stop investing in Africa but plans to boost security measures, the AP reported.] 'China now faces the dilemma of any country that undertakes an active foreign policy, particularly one with a foreign policy in no small part based on the acquisition of resources,' said an analysis by Stratfor, a security-consulting firm based in Austin, Texas. 'It must now decide how much to get involved in other countries' internal security issues.' He Wenping, head of Africa studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said safety issues were becoming increasingly important as the number of Chinese working abroad multiplies. Ms. He suggested to Beijing's Global Times newspaper Wednesday that Chinese companies evaluate the security situation before starting a project abroad. This is a sensitive political issue here. The Chinese public seems increasingly to demand that compatriots abroad be taken care of, even as the government expresses a determination to avoid involvement in local conflicts. Moreover, the urge to prop up endangered governments to preserve Chinese investments would go against its long tradition of noninterference. Reflecting the sensitivities, Communist Party censors sought Wednesday to limit comment on Internet sites about the killings in Ethiopia, according to site operators. But some telling observations got through the filters. 'If you want to make money there, why wouldn't you send your own troops to provide security?' one contributor wrote. 'It seems we should learn from the early colonial powers.' The Foreign Ministry, however, has long contended that China's economic activities in Africa are designed to benefit African countries and that China has no stake in the local political situation. Chinese officials repeatedly have said they have no desire to repeat the exploitative policies of colonial powers, which subjugated Africa to serve as a reliable source of raw materials and a market for exports. This was a major theme of a China-Africa summit in Beijing in November, when nearly 50 African heads of state and ministers gathered to proclaim friendship with China and discuss investment and aid. It also has been a major theme for Chinese leaders on frequent visits to Africa, including Mr. Hu's tour of eight countries in February. The pledge was repeated this week by Jia Qinglin, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, shown on the front pages of official newspapers Tuesday -- the day of the Ethiopia attack -- being greeted by dancing women on arrival in Kenya. 'Chinese economic activities in African countries are on the basis of cooperation and friendship,' said Liu Lide, a retired ambassador who spent 22 years as a Chinese envoy in Africa. 'That's the context in which we encourage Chinese companies to go to Africa and invest. We want to work not only with African governments but also with African people, particularly businessmen.' As China's economic footprint grows, however, its policies have brought increasing criticism from African opposition groups that contend China's noninterventionism props up unpopular governments. In Tuesday's attack, the target was an exploratory drilling site run by a subsidiary of the China Petroleum   Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec that has operations in a dozen countries. The oil field was guarded by a 100-strong contingent of Ethiopian soldiers. China was Ethiopia's largest trading partner in 2006, with $450 million in exchanges. Chinese firms have invested more than $70 million in Ethiopia, and Beijing has provided road- and school-construction aid. 'These people had bad intentions,' said Mr. Liu, the former ambassador, speaking of the rebels who carried out the attack. 'Their goal was to sabotage China's relations with the Ethiopian government.'

The first phase involved 27 contracts, corresponding to 50 projects, of which 21 have  been completed. These projects focused on areas of electricity, water, health, education, public works, each of which taking about 20 percent of the total amount released.The second phase included 13 contracts and 52 projects that are underway.

"1001","China","Concessional loan","2007","false","''The president of China, Hu Jintao, pledged nearly $100 million in grants and soft loans to Cameroon on Wednesday as he kicked off his latest tour of Africa, a growing supplier of oil and raw materials to his country. China has been offering low interest loans, debt relief and other incentives to increase its influence on the world's poorest continent in return for access to the natural resources it needs to feed its booming economy. 'China and Africa have developed mutually respectful and beneficial relations over the years,' Hu said at a banquet thrown by President Paul Biya of Cameroon, in a speech broadcast on state television and radio. 'China and Africa have never tried to impose their social and economic development models on others,' Hu added. Hu, who also toured Africa last year, met Biya to discuss social aid programs for clean drinking water and cheap housing, as well as a greater role for China in the local oil industry and other resource sectors.'Through you, I invite Chinese companies to come and invest in Cameroon, especially in hydrocarbons such as gas and oil, mineral exploitation and forestry, where numerous opportunities exist,' Biya said at a working session with Hu.Hu, the first Chinese head of state to visit Cameroon, was greeted by singing, dancing and flag-waving children. Citing the World Bank, Biya told Hu that since receiving debt relief under the so-called Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, Cameroon had become 'one of the best risks in Africa.'Hu arrived in Cameroon late Tuesday on the first leg of an eight- country tour that will also take him to Liberia, Sudan, Namibia, South Africa, Seychelles, Zambia and Mozambique.Hu and his group, which includes the minister of commerce, Bo Xilai, the foreign minister Li Zhaoxing and other senior policy makers, signed eight accords with Cameroon. Those deals included a 40 million yuan, or $5.15 million, grant and 30 million yuan interest-free loan for economic and technical cooperation, as well as two concessionary loans of 350 million yuan each, one for telecommunications projects. Hu also canceled Cameroon's debt to China - whose value was not specified - and signed agreements to build two schools and a hospital in Cameroon's commercial capital, Douala.China's trade with Cameroon, which has reserves of oil, bauxite and iron ore, doubled to $338 million in the first 11 months of 2006.At a special China-Africa summit in Beijing in November, Hu offered $5 billion in loans and credit to Africa and pledged to double aid, keen to demonstrate that China's ties with Africa went beyond thirst for its oil and raw materials.Trade between China and Africa jumped 40 percent to $55.5 billion in 2006, with the balance of trade $2.1 billion in Africa's favor, according to Chinese Trade Ministry data published this week by Xinhua, the official press agency.'Many African nations cannot look to the U.S. or Europe as models for development because they are simply too advanced,' said Hu Biliang, a senior economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government research group based in Beijing. 'China is a developing nation and ideologically similar,' the economist added. 'Oil and energy trade offer China and Africa a mutual opportunity to gain through trade, but more importantly China offers many African states an example of development, a road to follow.'But some Africans have warned that poor African countries may ultimately lose from expanding trade with China unless they carefully examine bilateral deals and protect their weak manufacturing sectors from inexpensive Chinese clothes and household goods. This means Hu may face a more guarded reception than in the past.Some Western leaders and analysts have criticized China for offering trade, aid and investment with no strings attached, saying it undermines efforts by Western donors to promote democracy and human rights through conditional aid.Hu's trip will also take him to Sudan, where civil war in the Darfur region has killed an estimated 200,000 people and forced 2.5 million more from their homes in violence that Washington has labeled as genocide. China has resisted sanctions and other pressure on Sudan, from which it buys crude oil, saying they will not help to solve the conflict in Darfur. But it said Wednesday that it would support a joint UN-African Union peacekeeping mission to Darfur.Document INHT000020070201e32100023''　据喀麦隆《论坛报》30日报道，喀麦隆政府将拨款240亿非洲法郎（约合5200万美元），帮助西北省“杀人湖”尼奥斯湖移民安居乐业和进一步治理“杀人湖”。　　该报援引喀麦隆西北省省长库帕·伊萨的讲话称，这笔资金将主要用于建设尼奥斯湖的毒气检测和排放系统以及移民迁入地区的水电供应系统和医疗卫生设施。　　伊萨说，喀麦隆政府“决定投入240亿非洲法郎，其中80亿非洲法郎已到位”。　　1986年8月21日夜，超量的二氧化碳气体突然从尼奥斯湖中喷出，掀起80多米高的水浪。随着闷雷般的轰响声，这股强大的气体在湖区周围迅速扩散和蔓延，仅半小时就使沿湖1746名居民和6000多头牲畜窒息死亡。　　尼奥斯湖为火山湖，海拔1091米，长2500米，宽1500米，平均水深200米，湖中存积着巨量二氧化碳和二氧化硫等有害气体，如遇地震或地层变化，便可能发生剧烈的喷发或爆炸。距离该湖不远的莫努恩湖于1984年8月15日也曾喷发过毒气，夺去数百人的生命。（记者陆遥）''新华网雅温得1月31日电（记者 钱彤 陆遥） 正在对喀麦隆进行国事访问的国家主席胡锦涛1月31日在雅温得同喀麦隆总统比亚举行会谈。双方就中喀关系、中非关系和其他共同关心的重大问题交换了意见，达成重要共识，一致同意共同努力，推动中喀友好合作关系和中非新型战略伙伴关系深入发展。    胡锦涛表示，建交36年来，中喀两国人民的传统友谊不断加深，两国友好合作关系稳定健康发展，取得了丰硕的成果。政治交往和合作有力地增强了双方政治互信，成为中喀友好合作关系的基础；多种形式的经贸合作不断深化，成为双方加强合作的优先领域；社会人文合作增进了两国人民的相互了解和友谊，成为双方深化合作的重要方面。喀麦隆政府坚定奉行一个中国政策，在台湾、人权等问题上给予中方宝贵支持，中方对此深表赞赏。    胡锦涛指出，实践证明，中喀友好合作关系有力促进了双方发展进步，符合两国和两国人民的根本利益。胡锦涛结合落实中非合作论坛北京峰会成果，就发展中喀关系提出建议：一、增强政治互信和合作，加强各层次往来和交流，在涉及各自利益的重大问题上继续相互支持和帮助。二、拓展互利双赢的经贸合作，确保在建合作项目按期保质完成，发挥经济互补优势，重点加强农业、初级产品加工、基础设施、能源、电信等领域的互利合作。三、密切社会人文领域的交流合作，加强教育、卫生、文化、体育、旅游等社会人文领域的交流，鼓励两国妇女、青年组织扩大交往。四、加强多边领域的协调和配合，在重大国际和地区问题上保持沟通和协调，维护发展中国家正当权益，共同推动建设持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐世界。 ' ","Unset","","","Unset","","Unset","Unset","","Cameroon","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=INHT000020070201e32100023&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Among the issues discussed and agreements made were the following: Assistance with dams and irrigation systems; possible Chinese involvement in reconstructing the Sena rail line, which was destroyed in the civil war; the reactivation of the Moatize coal mines; the resumed construction of the (formerly East German financed) Mocuba textile factory; assistance with increased agricultural production, especially of cash crops such as cotton and cashews; and parliamentary exchanges to deepen the relations between the two countries. The episode was sealed with a small cash gift of US$3.6m in development aid.Significance: Chissano praised China's aid in very warm terms - the country's re-awakened interest in Africa is good news for Mozambique, which can access cost-effective cooperation and take advantage of China's extensive expertise in large-scale infrastructure projects. It is worth noting that Chissano also called China's support 'genuine... not conditioned to certain interests as happens with some other countries'. China's non-judgemental attitude towards democracy and human rights issues make it an attractive alternative to the highly conditional aid packages offered by the EU and US. But what does China get in return? In the case of Mozambique, a foot in the door of one of the continent's most promising economies. In a wider sense, the chance to build up global diplomatic prestige at a low cost.

"1110","China","Road project to ease Nairobi traffic congestion- duplicate with 1027/1112","2007","false","'The president of Kenya, Mwai Kibaki, has launched a US$30-million road reconstruction project, funded by China, aimed at improving roads around the congested capital city, Nairobi. The total project includes the financing of three city bypasses, connecting the northern and southern corridor inter-regional road links, and reconstructing the main road leading from the airport to the industrial area. The project is the largest the Chinese have undertaken in Kenya and constitutes part of a US$86-million development package negotiated with China during the Beijing summit in 2006.Significance: Kenya’s dilapidated road system has been one of the main barriers to growth within the country. With Kenya acting as the supply corridor for Rwanda, Uganda, and southern Sudan, most freight traffic has to pass through the Nairobi city centre on its way to these countries, putting considerable pressure on the city’s infrastructure.The new bypass aims to divert this through traffic away from Nairobi's centre, improving transportation times as well as city infrastructure and traffic. The improvement of the northern and southern corridor connections will significantly facilitate inter-regional trade in a region where rail transportation is uncompetitive and grossly underdeveloped.' 'Once known as East Africa's green 'City in the Sun', Nairobi is so choked with traffic that Kenya's architects suggest moving to a new capital and angry business leaders say the booming economy is under threat.A combination of bad drivers, ramshackle vehicles, overloaded trucks, potholed roads and corrupt traffic police make one of Africa's biggest cities resemble the dodgems on a good day and, when things get really bad, reduce it to gridlock.Swarming minibuses, known as matatus, are the only option for most Nairobi commuters, but they are notorious for their drivers' kamikaze tactics and their crumbling mechanical condition -- which often means no lights at night.Matatus, weaving wildly from lane to lane, account for 80% of public transport and are a major cause of congestion.Fatal crashes are common. The Sunday Nation newspaper called a recent spate of matatu accidents a 'national slaughter'.Kenya's crumbling roads and the chaotic traffic have become a political issue ahead of elections in December, denting the popularity of President Mwai Kibaki.A recent survey said traffic jams were costing Nairobi drivers up to 50-million shillings (R5,2-million, $746 000) a day through increased fuel consumption, mechanical damage and pollution.'The amount of fuel used is astronomical, just sitting in traffic idling away, ' said Betty Maina, head of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers.'Things are delayed, you don't accomplish as much, it takes longer getting to meetings and events. You get up earlier trying to beat the traffic but sometimes you just cannot beat it.'She said the turnaround time for trucks and vans had doubled and some companies were increasing the sizes of their delivery vehicles because of the delays, compounding the problem.Shift capital? The Architectural Association of Kenya (AAK) last month asked the government to move the capital elsewhere.'Nairobi was designed half a century ago for a population of half a million people while the population today is three million. This has overstretched entirely all the services of the whole city,' AAK chairperson Gideon Mulyungi said in a speech.City traffic is worst on Friday evenings, especially near pay day. When rain turns the potholes into ponds, there is chaos.The jams are regularly compounded by a string of accidents and breakdowns, many involving ancient trucks which have a tendency to roll backwards down Nairobi's many hills.Nairobi's traffic lights are largely ignored.The police, known for being more interested in bribes from harassed motorists than untangling the jams, often overrule the lights anyway and their efforts can make the hold-ups worse.Yet experts, including Japanese road engineers who did a two-year study, say Nairobi's problems are not insurmountable and nothing like as complex as some cities.While traffic has expanded -- some estimates say by 300% in a decade -- the roads have not.'The problem is the growth of vehicles compared to the rate of developing the road network. For some time this has not been developing while traffic expanded,' city engineer Charles Chiruri said.There is only one road, the Uhuru Highway, running right through the city and it is punctuated by a string of roundabouts acting as anarchic traffic traps.The highway is used not only by most commuters but also by heavy trucks transiting to all parts of the country, including from the port of Mombasa to Uganda and Central Africa.'Missing links' Plans to overcome Nairobi's congestion -- bypasses, overpasses and 14 'missing links' to avoid long detours -- began 30 years ago. Nothing was done.The reason, say experts, was systematic corruption during the 24-year rule of former President Daniel arap Moi, who was replaced in 2002 by Kibaki.For the decade after 1994, foreign donor funding, essential for building new roads, dried up because of the huge graft.'By 2002, things were so bad that what was happening was there was no competitive tendering at all. Just a cartel of five cowboy contractors,' said a former government engineer who asked not to be named.'They quoted whatever they liked and then doubled or tripled it. They got paid and did not do the job and then claimed more because of bad weather.'By the end of the Moi era only 20% of the country's roads were in adequate condition.It is taking years to overcome the backlog. Een now, five years later, about 57% of the network is in poor shape, while the booming economy puts even more cars on the road.Big donor countries privately express frustration that the comprehensive 2006 Japanese plan for solving Nairobi's road and traffic problems has still not been implemented.Roads Ministry spokesperson Richard Abura said it had taken time to find donors to fund the work. 'Early this year we started implementing the report. We are going to concession the bypasses as soon as we get some funding.'In April, President Kibaki announced plans for a two billion Kenyan shilling (R209-million, $30-million) Chinese project to widen the Uhuru Highway and link it to the west of the city.But some Western donors complain this is not coordinated with the Japanese plan and many people remain sceptical at the pace of change.'I don't think this is going to improve in the short term. The issue with Nairobi is that there just isn't a comprehensive plan in place yet,' said Maina of the manufacturers' association. - Reuters ' 'Expansion and reconstruction works on the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), Uhuru Highway to Gigiri road is set to begin.This follows the signing today of additional funding for the road at a ceremony at State House Nairobi witnessed by President Mwai Kibaki and Mr Jia Qinglin, the chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.Today's signing of an economic and technical cooperation amounting to 532m Kenya shillings brought the total commitment by China on construction of the JKIA-Gigiri road to 2.1bn shillings.President Kibaki and Mr Qinglin will this Thursday 26th April, 2007 officially launch construction work of the road at Nyayo National Stadium, Nairobi West. The construction will include street lighting, an extra lane on some sections of the road, while some landmark roundabouts, that Nairobi residents and visitors have been accustomed to will be discarded.During the occasion, Finance Minister Amos Kimunya on behalf of the Kenya government and Chinese Trade Minister Wei Jianguo on the Chinese side also exchanged notes on a project of cooperative archaeological investigation on Lamu Archipelago amounting to 177m shillings, a feasibility study on a project to build a hospital in Kenya and a feasibility study on a project to build two rural schools.Earlier, President Kibaki and the visiting chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held bilateral talks where the two leaders lauded the cordial relations existing between the two countries.President Kibaki thanked the Chinese government for its continued financial support to Kenya's development, noting that China is one of Kenya's major development partners.The president recalled that Kenya and China have signed various bilateral agreements and memorandum of understanding on projects that have gone a long way to improve the lives of Kenyans.On his part, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference commended President Kibaki's leadership, saying that during the short time he has been in office the relationship between Kenya and China has improved significantly.In this regard, Mr Qinglin assured President Kibaki that China will continue supporting Kenya's development endeavours in the spirit of cooperation.Also present were ministers Simeon Nyachae, Raphael Tuju, Prof George Saitoti and Suleiman Shakombo, the head of public service and secretary to the cabinet Amb Francis Muthaura, several permanent secretaries and senior government officials. ' 'NAIROBI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - China has lent Kenya 8.55 billion shillings ($120 million) to build two new roads to improve traffic flow in the east African nation's normally congested capital, a government statement said.The money will be used to construct the Eastern and Northern bypasses whose total length will be about 70 km (44 miles).The government has had a long-standing plan to construct four bypasses outside the central business district to check road congestion which usually brings Nairobi traffic to a crawl.'The Kenyan government approached the Chinese government to request for funds to construct the project roads,' a statement by the roads ministry seen by Reuters on Thursday said.'The Chinese government responded positively to fund the project through the Export Buyer's Credit.'The Chinese government will pay contractors China Road and Bridge Corporation, C88, Zhonglu Plaza and Andingmenwai Dajie directly, the statement said.Post-election turmoil has killed over 850 people and hurt Kenya's image as a stable country in a troubled region and led to threats by western donors to freeze aid.Analysts however say western powers pressing newly re-elected President Mwai Kibaki to find a solution to the crisis do not have much leverage as China is increasingly playing a bigger role in Africa and can provide an alternative source of investment and political support.

As a member of trade blocs such as COMESA and SADC, it offers a gateway to African markets comprising half a billion people.'That gives China a springboard for entry into Africa,' Ramgoolam said.One of his aides said several Chinese companies were expected to invest or to increase their investment in Mauritius, and may use some of the $10 billion of development funds that China has earmarked for Africa.He said China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange is set to invest in Mauritian treasury bonds, while the China Development Bank planned to open an office in Mauritius.Construction was due to begin in October on a planned $500 million Chinese investment to build a trade development zone -- the largest ever foreign direct investment into Mauritius.Ramgoolam said despite his country's lack of natural resources, he had persuaded Beijing to adopt Mauritius as a focus of Chinese investment in Africa.'It was a question of persuasion, but you have to build on the relationship that you have,' he said, noting Mauritius' decision in 1972 to support Beijing with its one-China policy.Since Ramgoolam won elections in July 2005, the government has tried to improve the investment climate by speeding up procedures for business and registration permits and introducing flat rates of corporate and income tax at 15 percent.Ramgoolam said he had asked China for its continued support with Mauritian sovereignty claims on the Chagos Islands, part of Mauritius until independence. Claimed by Britain, one of the islands -- Diego Garcia -- houses a major U.S. military base.Facing the end of preferential trade deals on its key sugar and textile sectors, Mauritius is opening and diversifying its economy to attract foreign direct investment.Asked whether he feared an increased Chinese presence might hit the Mauritian textiles sector even further, Ramgoolam said his country had no other choice than to reform its economy.'With the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and the globalised world, we have to make efforts to restructure our economy,' he said. 'We cannot buck the market.'CHINA-MAURITIUS/ (INTERVIEW)|LANGEN|ABN|M|D|AFN|AFA|CSA|LBY|RWSA|RWS|REULB|GNS|SXNADocument LBA0000020070724e37l0018g","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Roads and Communication","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Mauritius","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070724e37l0018g&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved. Work on a planned US$820-million economic and trade co-operation zone, backed by China, has started in Mauritius. The zone was originally called the Tianli Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone but has been renamed the Jinfei Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone after two new investors, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and the Shanxi Coking Coal Group, took up 50% and 30% stakes in the development, reducing Tianli's stake to 20%. According to Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam, quoted by Reuters, the trade zone, once finished, is projected to boost current exports by over a third. The investment remains China's largest in the country.Significance: Mauritius is currently undergoing a programmed structural change, partly forced by the removal of both the multi-fibre agreement and preferential sugar prices.With government support the diversification of the county’s services and goods export base, as well as the fundamental growth industries’ interest in investing in planned trade and economic zones, has sprung up over the last couple of years. The original project (initially US$500 million) brought forward by Tianli was expected to attract around 40 Chinese companies within the 210-acre project and adding around 500 jobs to the domestic economy. With Tianli already established in the Mauritian textile industry, the company is expected to attract engineering, computer science, electrical, pharmaceuticals, food processing, handicraft, and textile companies to the zone.Document WDAN000020090917e59h0002c毛里求斯总理等对晋非合作区发展寄予厚望2009-09-21 22:35  文章来源：毛里求斯快报文章类型：编译  内容分类：新闻　　毛里求斯晋非经贸合作区于9月16日正式开工，毛政府高层对合作区项目高度关注，对中方所做的工作给予了高度评价并对合作区今后发展寄予厚望。　　毛总理拉姆古兰在开工仪式上表示，晋非合作区是毛迄今为止规模最大、吸收外资最多的项目，将对毛经济向着现代化、多元化方向发展起到积极的推进作用。　　毛副总理兼财长拉•西塔南对合作区开工表示由衷高兴，他指出，中国选择在资源匮乏的毛建立经贸合作区显示了其对毛国经济发展的信心，合作区的开工建设将帮助毛摆脱经济危机的不利影响，山西太原钢铁集团、山西焦煤集团的加入和中非发展基金的支持将进一步增强合作区总体实力。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　驻毛里求斯使馆经商参处　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　二〇〇九年九月二十一日　　（信息来源：驻毛里求斯经商参处子站）白培中赴毛里求斯考察经贸合作项目                                                                                 号:[ 大　中　小 ]                                    发布时间:2009-07-14                                                                          来源:山西焦煤集团网站                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              6月29日至7月6日，由山西省商务厅厅长王淑珍带队，集团公司董事长、党委书记白培中、太原钢铁集团、山西天利实业集团有关领导组成的考察团赴毛里求斯进行了经贸合作专题考察。    毛里求斯政府对毛里求斯经济贸易合作区建设和山西代表团的来访非常重视。在毛期间，毛总理拉姆古兰委托其首席高级幕僚接见了考察团主要成员。毛里求斯副总理兼财长思达南与考察团主要成员进行了会晤。毛投资促进局总经理拉米，贾杜及其高级顾问等会见了考察团全体成员，双方举行了正式会谈，就项目的深入推进交换了意见，达成了广泛共识。     考察团一行围绕未来经贸合作园区定位、发展规划的进一步优化、争取毛政府的政策支持等主题内容，对毛政治、经济、人文状况特别是投资环境进行了全面细致的实地考察，掌握了第一手资料。     考察团还访问了中国驻毛大使馆，拜会了大使、经济参赞及经商处有关专家，征求他们对当地经济合作园区建设的意见和建议；考察了毛南部水产养殖基地、市政规划建设；拜访了毛里求斯侨界社团主要负责人。                                                                                                                                                                               责任编辑: 高玉洁 ","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Implementation","2","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Mauritius","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020090917e59h0002c&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

They will undertake activities in the northern port of Nacala, in exploiting mineral resources, and in supplying agricultural equipment.Sergio Vieira, Director of the Zambezi Valley Planning Office (GPZ), who headed the Mozambican side to the talks, said that the agreements should be implemented as quickly as possible.He expected them to take effect later this year.'Cooperation with China will bring Mozambique the equipment we need, with the advantage that it is cheaper than from other sources', Vieira said.For Wang Cheng An, General Secretary of the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and the Portuguese Speaking Countries, the three memoranda mark the beginning of business cooperation in the areas concerned, which he regarded as important for the economic development of Mozambique.The upgrading of Nampula port, situated on the best natural deep water harbour on the east African coast, would be a good sign for the development of trade, he said, while the supply of Chinese agricultural equipment could play a significant role in increasing Mozambican agricultural production.Neither the Mozambican nor the Chinese delegation put any figures on the amount of Chinese investment involved, with Vieira only speaking of 'important financial sums'.Vieira also took the opportunity to deny that China will pay Mozambique's debt to Portugal, arising from the transfer of the Cahora Bassa dam on the Zambezi from Portuguese to Mozambican majority ownership.The sum is around 950 million US dollars, and some reports have appeared that the Chinese Exim Bank (represented on the delegation) will pay this sum.Vieira replied that, although the Exim Bank has signed an agreement to finance another dam on the Zambezi, at Mepanda Ncua, some 70 kilometres downstream from Cahora Bassa, it is not involved in the Cahora Bassa negotiations at all.A memorandum of understanding on Cahora Bassa was signed in Lisbon in November, under which the shareholding structure of the dam operating company, HCB, will be radically altered. Currently the Portuguese state holds 82 per cent of the shares, and Mozambique just 18 per cent. Under the November arrangement the positions would be reversed, with Mozambique holding 85 per cent of the HCB shares, and Portugal 15 per cent.But the deal has not yet been finalised, despite initial hopes that everything could be wrapped up by the end of 2005.Discussions on supposedly 'technical' issues have dragged on for months, and so far not a single share has been transferred from Portugal to Mozambique.The Mozambican government has declined to state where it will obtain the funds to pay Portugal for the shares - but a loan should not be difficult to arrange, given that HCB is now a profitable company, and there should be no difficulty in repaying a loan from Mozambique's share in those profits.

The 400 megawatts of electricity Namibia is planning to import via the Caprivi line from Zambia by 2009 represents more than double the amount of power the country is generating itself at the moment. With the completion of projects such as the Kudu Gas Field even further on the horizon, this line may bring in cheaper electricity than from South Africa to meet the ever-increasing demand. The chief technical adviser of NamPower, Rainer Jagau, confirmed that a delegation of the Chinese national corporation for the construction and import and export of agricultural machinery [CAMC] had held talks with the national power utility. However, he stressed that, as was the case with other offers from various places, NamPower would carefully compare the proposals with conditions elsewhere on the open market. Ms Liu Jianling, managing director of the department for business development of the Chinese company CAMS, paid a courtesy call on State House together with the economic adviser of the Chinese Embassy last week. The next day they were scheduled to meet the new chief executive officer of NamPower. Before the talks began behind closed doors, one of Pohamba's officials described the project to be discussed as a 'ery urgent project.' According to the Chinese they are in a great hurry to finance a contract after the signing of a general cooperation agreement with the Namibian Government during the State visit of the president to China in December last year. According to Mr Jagau it is however not a settled thing that CAMC would be a partner in the Caprivi project. The link of northern Namibia over Sesheke and Livingstone to the power network of the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation [Zesco] will according to reports cost about 3 billion Namibian dollars. The ability to supplement Namibia's power demands on a large scale from this quarter depends amongst others on upgrading in Zambia, which has been topping the agenda of Zesco for the past years. In the inner rooms of State House it is speculated that the Inga Project, which eventually will use the same infrastructure, is probably the only long term solution to the region's electricity predicament. This project will according to plans assist the whole of Southern Africa with power from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The annual turnover of CAMS, established in 1982, amounts according to their website to about 200m US dollars, which is 1.3bn Namibian dollars. Between 40 and 60 per cent of this money is obtained from overseas contracts. At the end of May the Chinese government-owned company, according to the Mozambican Information Agency, was on the agenda of a high-level business conference in Maputo. The same report on allAfrica.com says Mozambique signed a cooperation agreement in April according to which the Exim Bank of China would lend 2.3bn US dollars (nearly 15bn Namibian dollars) for work on the Mepandua N'kua and Bue Maria dams. According to Mr Jagau the infrastructure for the Caprivi line should be completed by 2009. He therefore stressed that NamPower's strategy for the next years, like in South Africa and Zambia, would be to economize.

France, Luxembourg and the European Union have donated close to 5,000 mt, the official, Ada Chaifou, said from Niamey. Chaifou, an adviser within the prime minister's Food Crisis Unit, said non-governmental organisations CARITAS, the local Red Cross, World Vision and a consortium of US NGOs had also responded well to the appeal. The Roman Catholic Church donated 1,230 mt of millet.China, the Swiss Cooperation, Niger's members of parliaments, private investors and others have contributed money. The bulk of aid is destined for residents of Difa, Maradi, Tillaberi and Zinder who were the most hungry. Eight months after the appeal, Chaifou said, 'there are no signs of distress.' He added that the government programme enabling the hungry to buy cereals cheaply had effectively warded-off the threat of famine and the drift of rural folk to urban areas.Some 53,000 mt have been sold under this programme, expected to end on 30 October.More donations are expected by the end of the year, he said, especially after a recent World Food Programme appeal.

It has inked an agreement with Canada's Allana Potash Corp to develop the project jointly. China Mining United Fund raised RMB 500 million (US$73.2 million) in its first phase of fundraising, but sources said the project needs much more capital investment.Allana Potash signed a strategic agreement in November with an affiliate of China Mining United Fund, China Mineral United Management Ltd., to place shares worth 2 million Canadian dollars (US$1.96 million) to the fund. The proceeds of the initial investment will be used to finance exploration and development of the potash project in Danakil Depression in northeastern Ethiopia.Under the agreement, China Mineral would acquire 20% of the total potash production of the project and finance 35% of its construction costs, estimated at around US$280 million, Allana said on its Web site. It said the Chinese mining fund is closely linked to one of the largest fertilizer companies in China, but didn't name the company.CIC, China’s US$300 billion sovereign wealth fund, is studying whether to take a stake in the potash project, or finance part of the project's construction costs.Uncertainty still surrounds the project as mining giant BHP Billiton Ltd, which has exploration licenses in Ethiopia, reportedly shows interest in it.CIC’s Deals in Resources Noble Group Limited (commodities)       US$-858-millionPT Bumi Resources Tbk (coal)    US$1.9 billion SouthGobi Energy Resources Ltd (coal)   US $500 million  Nobel Oil Group based in Russia (integrated, upstream petroleum)        US$ 300 million  JSC KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (oil)    US$939 million Teck Resources Limited (metal, metallurgical coal and molybdenum)       US$ 3.5 billion BBMG Corporation (cement) Yingde Gases Group Company Limited (gases)","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Ethiopia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=GCPERD0020100401e63t0002u&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Various consortiums are jostling for a stake in the second phase of the the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) ahead of a Chinese business delegation scheduled to arrive in the country next week.Speaking at a media briefing in Johannesburg yesterday, Mabitsela-Kotsekgolo 'MK' Malefane, the international investment and business development adviser at Imexpo, said a delegation of 75 Chinese nationals representing various interests would take part in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and China trade fair and investment forum starting on May 18.The LHWP would be among the ventures discussed and developers would seek funding from the Chinese.Malefane was tight-lipped about the details of the project, and would not reveal which South African companies could benefit from this lucrative deal.The LHWP is a bilateral venture between South Africa and Lesotho worth $2 billion (R13.5bn). It is an ongoing water and power supply project, with a hydropower component led by Lesotho and dam development led by South Africa.The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority says the purpose of the project is to provide an income to Lesotho by 'transferring water from the catchment of the Senqu/Orange River in Lesotho' to meet South Africa's demand.The project is scheduled to be completed in 10 years' time after the construction of five different phases.Document CAPTIM0020110511e75b0002x ","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Hydropower","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Africa, regional, Lesotho, South Africa","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=CAPTIM0020110511e75b0002x&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Ghanaian Minister of Communications Albert Kan Dapaah, Chinese ambassador to Ghana Lu Yonjshou, CEO of GT Oystein Bjorge, and Chairman of Alcatel Shanghai Bell Yuan Xin are all familiar with the project. In December 2003, the project was suspended because of a lawsuit against GT by Malaysian G-Gom. According to reports in 2005, the project was continued with the installation of 250 radio antenna to serve about 400,000 mobile phone users. 60 Chinese engineers are participating in the project. It is still unclear if the project was completed, but it appears to be untied. Phase 1 of the project appears to have been completed with the help of 60 Chinese engineers. Sources confirmed that Phase 2 was beginning in 2005.(PPIAF) In 2005, Ghana Telecom signed a buyer credit agreement with Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Bank (SG CIB) worth $67 million USD. The agreement carries a maturity of 6 years. Funds will be used to upgrade and expand Ghana Telecom's networks, financing the import of equipment from Alcatel Shanghai Bell. The loan is insured by Sinosure, the Chinese export credit agency.  Phase 2 of Ghana telecom project includes the supply of fixed network exchanges, mobile network equipment, and optical transfer equipment. Sinosure prevented default on this deal, after receiving preliminary notice of potential default in February 2007. There is some confusion that this might be a 50-50 Chinese-French joint venture. The total cost for Phase 2 appears to be $80 million USD, and the Chinese will commit $67 million USD.

Speaking at the inauguration of a seven-member Technical Advisory Committee on GRC Lands, Prof. Ameyaw-Akumfi said the Committee would take care of Railway lands and their associate problems.The Committee would also trace all land allocations and illegal developments on such lands, especially, in areas like Accra-Tema, Kumasi and Sekonddi-Takoradi. He said Chinese Government, one of Ghana's development partners had indicated to the government its willingness to help expand rail to the north.A Chief State Attorney, Ms. Ama Banful chairs the Committee whose other members include Mr. George Mensah, Town and Country Planning Dept., Mr. Appiah-Adu, Lands Commission and Mr. Agyei Tabi, Ministry of Local Government. Others are Mr. D.K Osei, AMA, Mr. Albert Adjei, Shama Ahanta East Metro Assembly and Mr. Ampong of KMA.It has been two months now since the Ghana Railway Company sacked traders from the railway tracks at Kantamanto, Accra. A source told ADM that the absence of the traders from their premises has been a big relief to them.The source said some of the traders made the place into homes, doing all kinds of things like cooking which had burnt the wood supporting the tracks. There were exposing themselves to grave risks, he said, and 'even a train had cut one of the traders' leg some time ago.'One of the traders, who used to sell goods on the railway tracks, told the ADM that seven months ago, the G.R.C. served them with ejection notices. The trader said they petitioned the ministry, which oversees the operations of the GRC. The ministry promised to relocate them but suddenly the railway authorities sacked them.Another rail track market woman said they now find it very difficult to get a place to sell, 'We do not have a place to sit and do our selling' and added that when they sell on the pavements the Accra Metropolitan Assembly guards also drive them off and seize their wares.by Grace Akrasi Asare, InternCopyright Accra Mail.

"1523","China","TAZARA - Tazara Gets $5 Million Worth of Equipment (Duplicate of 2276)","2006","false","Tazara Gets $5 Million Worth of Equipmentby OSEPH MWAMUNYANGE657 words30 October 200604:06 PMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2006 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedNairobi, Oct 30, 2006 (The East African/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --The Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (Tazara) has received new equipment and machinery worth $5 million to improve its operations.Tazara spokesman Clement Mwiya last week told The EastAfrican that the Authority has, throughout its existence, received assistance in the form of interest free loans advanced to the two Contracting States - Tanzania and Zambia by the Chinese government.'It is no a secret that Tazara is today beset with problems arising from the lack of sustained capital injection,' he said.The acquisition of 50 light truck trolleys, 50 sets of 50 tonne covered wagons and lifting equipment consisting of four sets of 10 tonne forklifts, with spares, will greatly enhance Tazara's efficiency and help it meet demands from both passenger and freight markets.Other equipment includes four sets of eight tonne mobile cranes, with spare parts and 20 sets of 80 tonne hydraulic jacks, also with spares.Mr Mwiya said that the wagons and equipment would be a big boost and 'could not have come at a better time than now when we just embarked on the rehabilitation of mainline locomotives, for increased capacity and efficient services.' General Electric of the US is rehabilitating the engines.He said that, with the support from the Chinese government and the Contracting States, the volume of traffic moved on Tazara is expected to grow from the current annual of 600,000mt to 800,000mt for freight and one million to 1.2 million passengers over the next five years. 'This will increase total revenue from the current $35 million to $55 million per annum, helping the railway to become profitable,' said Mr Mwiya.In view of the fact that there has been lack of sustained capital injection, the company has in the last few years been transporting just about 650,000 tonnes of cargo, and one million passengers per annum, almost half of what it used to move at its peak in the late 1980s or indeed at the peak of copper production in Zambia.On the last aspect of copper movement, Mr Mwiya said that Tazara was expecting more of the metal from Zambia because of huge investments made in the landlocked country in opening new mines.Tazara has since last year been collaborating with Zambian copper mining company Konkola Copper Mine in the rehabilitation of its rolling stock, which includes wagons and engines.Mr Mwiya told The EastAfrican mid last year that they were expecting an upswing in the amount of cargo shipped from and to neighbouring Zambia's mining companies and thus would collaborate with Koncola to acquire spares and ensure speedy movement of goods.Tazara is gearing for what he termed as 'an upswing in the amount of copper and cobalt exports from Zambia because of increased copper production from the present mines and new mines like Kansanshi in north-western Zambia.' More than 10 years ago, when Zambia started privatising its mines, many firms from outside the landlocked country arrived on the scene.The big companies include Mopani Copper Mines, First Quantum Minerals, Cyprus Amax Zambia Corporation, Caledonia Mining.Before this, the mines were under the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd, after they were nationalised from Roan Mine Corporation and Rokana Mine Corporation, which were under Anglo-American Corporation.Tazara is receiving more enquiries from Zambia, where more companies want to transport their cargo through Dar es Salaam. 'This is because of an improvement in both, the transit time to Zambia and speedy clearance of goods at the port of Dar es Salaam. It is worth noting that services at the port have improved tremendously, especially with containerised cargo,' said Mr Mwiya.One of the mining companies that have made enquiries is First Quantum Minerals, which runs Bwana Mkubwa Mines one of the oldest mines in Zambia, on the outskirts of Ndola.Document AFNWS00020061031e2au0002a","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","In-kind contribution","Unset","","Africa, regional, Tanzania, Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020061031e2au0002a&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Work started on the project on December 29 at Amasaman in the Ga District regarding the section of the Accra-Kumasi road from Ofankor to Nsawam. The road is aspaltic dual carriage way. The project includes the construction of a 20 meter fly-over bridge over the rail line near Ofankor. The design can handle 13 tons. The construction of the road was started by the New Patriotic Party administration under former president Kufuor via Internally Generated Funds. In 2009, when the NPP left office, most of the road had been completed, but the Apedwa portion of the road was still under construction. The project is untied.

"1448","China","Not Bilateral : Construction of light rail network in Addis Ababa","2011","false","Addis Ababa, March. 30 -- India and China will help build a railway network across Ethiopia that would significantly improve the east African nation's transport system. India has pledged $300 million for the national rail network construction while China's Export and Import (EXIM) Bank has inked a deal to finance 85 percent of the cost of a light rail network in the capital city of Addis Ababa at $490 million. The cost of the rail network across the country has been estimated at $6 billion, according to an initial estimation. 'India has pledged to provide us with $300 million for the project as part of its assistance to the infrastructure development of African countries,' Ethiopian Transport Minister Diriba Kuma told the Capital newspaper. 'We have asked India for another $300 million for the project,' he said. The rail network is part of the country's Growth and Transformation Plan that sets a target of construction of a 2,395-km national rail track.The Addis Ababa track would be 36.5 km long. Diriba told parliament every kilometre of the national track would cost $2-3 million. Based on this calculation, the average cost for a prioritised 1,808-km network would amount to around $4.5 billion. The Addis Ababa rail network, supplemented by buses and taxis, would help in solving the ever-increasing transportation problems the city was facing, officials said. China has also given four buses, whose manufacturing would be emulated locally as part of the government's plan to deploy 500 new buses in the capital.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Indo-Asian News Service.

It is believed that with the joint efforts of all parties concerned, this visit will certainly be completely successful, and will make contributions to advancing cooperation between China and other developing countries and consolidating relations between China and Saudi Arabia and between China and Africa.When answering a question about China's aid to Africa, Zhai Jun said: At the 2006 Beijing Summit, President Hu announced that in the next three years, China would double its aid to Africa, and this target will be achieved within this year. During the visit, President Hu will exchange ideas with leaders of the five countries on the issues of common interest in economic and trading cooperation, and will also provide new assistance to the African countries. Consultations on the concrete arrangements are under way.When answering a question about the implementation of the eight measures China announced at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, Zhai Jun said: The eight measures are scheduled in the period from 2007 to 2008, and this year is the last year for the implementation of the eight measures. So far, the eight measures have been implemented rather smoothly. During the 2007 UN General Assembly, the Chinese foreign minister and his counterparts in the African countries held their first round of political consultation, and thus started the foreign minister-level political consultation mechanism between China and Africa. China has completely fulfilled the measure of exempting all tariffs for the products exported by the least developed African countries to China. The work of exempting part of the due debts owed to China by poor African countries with heavy debt burdens and with diplomatic relations with China has also basically completed. The China-Africa Development Fund has been smoothly started, and has been invested in 20 projects so far. The China-funded project of construction the assembly building for the African Union was officially started last December, and the project is going on smoothly. Up to the end of 2008, China provided training for 11,000 people of all types in African countries, dispatched 125 young volunteers to work in Africa, selected 100 senior agricultural specialists, and is now sending them to Africa continuously. The China-funded projects of hospitals, anti-malaria centres, and schools are smoothly under construction. By the end of this year, the Chinese side will smoothly fulfil President Hu Jintao's eight promises of offering aid to Africa.When answering a question about the impact of the financial crisis on the China-Africa cooperation and China's countermeasures, Zhai Jun said: As the financial crisis has affected all countries in the world, it certainly may also affect African countries and China as well, and may produce certain impact on China-Africa cooperation. In particular, some Chinese enterprises may encounter difficulties in their African business operation. The Chinese side has paid close attention to this issue, and is taking a series of measures to enhance cooperation with African countries, to jointly face such challenges and strive to lower the adverse impact to a minimum. The Chinese side will make greater efforts in work to fulfil the eight measures announced by President Hu, will fulfil the promises of offering aid to Africa by meeting the qualitative and quantitative standards as scheduled, and will continue to encourage and support Chinese enterprises to make investment and launch business ventures in African countries. It is believed with the joint efforts of both sides, we will be able to smoothly cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the China-Africa cooperation.When answering a question about Chinese leaders' visits to Africa, Zhai Jun said: Chinese leaders paid many visits to Africa, because relations between China and Africa are good. China and African countries have profound traditional friendships. Both sides share similar experience in history, and also face common development tasks in the new period. The Chinese government and Chinese leaders always attach great importance to developing a friendly and cooperative relationship with African countries, take African countries as our good friends, good partners, good brothers. We treat each other with sincerity, pursue mutually beneficial cooperation, and make common development. The fact that Chinese leaders paid many visits to African countries fully showed the important position of developing cooperation and friendship with Africa in China's foreign policy.Zhai Jun said: With the exception of Saudi Arabia, four of the five countries that President Hu will visit this time are not rich in energy and resources. This fully shows that China-Africa relations are not merely energy and resources relations. Energy and resources cooperation is a component of the China-Africa cooperation, but not the whole of such cooperation. We have profound traditional friendship with these four African countries, and also have a very good condition of mutually beneficial cooperation in various aspects.Source: Xinhua news agency domestic service, Beijing, in Chinese 1502 gmt 6 Feb 09 BAMAKO: Thousands of people cheered and banged drums here on Friday as President Hu Jintao and his Malian counterpart Amadou Toumani Toure laid the foundation stone for the city's third China-funded bridge across the Niger River.'The bridge represents a new level of cooperation between China and Mali,' Hu said at the laying ceremony.'Although we haven't given a name to the bridge, today we can officially name it Bridge of Malian-Chinese Friendship,' Toure said.Local people had every reason to celebrate, as the new bridge is designed to ease traffic congestion in the city.'The third bridge will be very good for us,' Nene Rokiatou Thiam, an employee of Hotel L'Amitie, said.Toure talked with Hu about Bamako's need for a third crossing during their meeting three years ago at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Malian president said on Friday.In 2007, Toure was told that China was willing to finance the bridge, and soon after teams of Chinese and Malian engineers began working on its design.About 40 Chinese engineers and technical workers arrived in Bamako three months ago to start construction.China hopes to build a 'top-level' bridge and 'a new bridge of friendship', Hu said.The structure, about 10 km from downtown Bamako, will be almost 2.3 km long and 24 m wide and carry four traffic lanes, Ma Jiangquan, deputy engineer general of the No 2 Co of the China Gezhouba Group International, which is building it, said.The project will cost almost 346 million yuan ($51 million).The firm plans to send about 70 managers, engineers and technicians to work on the it, as well as employing between 500 and 1,000 local workers.'We try to make the best use of all local resources,' Shi Li, vice-president of China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co Ltd, told China Daily.'This will help alleviate unemployment and improve the skills of local workers.'The bridge is expected to take about 40 months to complete.'The advent of China and other emerging players as important financiers (in infrastructure building) represents an encouraging trend for Africa, given the magnitude of its infrastructure deficit,' a report entitled Building Bridges China's Growing Role as Infrastructure Financier for Africa said.The report, commissioned by the World Bank and released last year, also said the investments made by these emerging financiers are unprecedented in scale, and in their focus on large-scale infrastructure projects.Eer since Mali won independence in 1960, its population has grown fast, especially in Bamako, home to about 2 million people.Along with steady economic development, the city has also witnessed a steady increase of motor vehicles growing.

He said Ghana was positioning herself for partnership with developed countries in the global village on a win-win principle.President Kufuor made the call when Mr. Wei Jianguo, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce, led a Chinese Government delegation on Bilateral Economic Co-operation and Trade in Ghana to pay a courtesy call on him at the Castle, Osu.He said the Government was creating the enabling friendly business atmosphere to attract investors to utilize the resources that had made Ghana the potential gateway to the West African Sub-Region.'These natural resources are virtually begging for exploitation and we want partners to exploit them for our mutual benefit', he said.President Kufuor cited the bauxite deposits in Ghana and other neighbouring countries that could be developed because Ghana had a smelter, hydro-energy resources and the gas pipeline project that could be utilised for processing bauxite into alumina for export to the global market.Mr. Wei said about 16 Chinese entrepreneurs were willing to invest in Ghana under joint ventures with their Ghanaian counterparts.He said negotiations were under way to establish an industrial zone to attract Chinese investors to invest in agro-processing, solar energy and communications.'There are potentials in our bilateral relations and efforts would be made to improve and sustain it', he said.Document LQAF000020040315e03f0005m","Multisector","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Ghana","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LQAF000020040315e03f0005m&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Ltd., the producer.China-made pick-up trucks have already been exported to more than 40 countries and regions and they are especially popular in the Middle East and Africa.Quality is the key factor in the Chinese pick-up industry's competitive edge with foreign firms, and the comparatively low price contributes to large exports, said experts from the China Automotive Industry Association.China will abolish the quota on imported automobiles by 2006, in line with its WTO commitments, which will also offer greater opportunities for its automobile exports because other countries will provide preferential policies for imported Chinese automobiles in return.Chinese automobiles are expected to take over 15 per cent of the international market in the next three years, say experts.(XIC).Document APULSE0020031016dzag000mg","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Transport","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Libya","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=APULSE0020031016dzag000mg&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"1666","China","Fake Seiko Watches (not a project, never made transfer)","2003","false","5 May 2003 Last year, 1,070 fake Seiko watches were discovered in a cargo plane bound for Libya via Australia from China. Those cases demonstrate that China is not only a production base of copies of Japanese products, but also a major export base for these products.Firms dissatisfied with govtIn the Yomiuri Shimbun survey, companies suffering from infringements said they were dissatisfied with the Japanese government.Of 280 companies that responded, 139 called for government efforts to enhance controls through bilateral or multilateral talks.The government has asked China to enhance controls of copied products and other intellectual property infringements, but the spread of copycat products in China has not stopped.At a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum held in Los Cabos, Mexico, in October, the government proposed setting up offices in all APEC countries to accept complaints of intellectual property infringements.But due to opposition from China, this plan was not approved.Some companies say Japan should pressure China more strongly, as the United States has done to Japan over bilateral trade disputes.A spokesman for a motorcycle manufacturer said, 'Japan should put pressure on China to introduce numerical targets for reducing intellectual property violations.'On the other hand, 145 companies in the survey said it takes too long for the registration of intellectual property to be granted.The Patent Office now reportedly holds about 500,000 pending applications. It takes an average of 22 months between the acceptance of an application and the time it is examined, compared with 14.4 months in the United States.Furthermore, some companies distrust the Patent Office. 'The Patent Office may not accept an application because it doesn't have enough employees to make a proper investigation,' a company spokesman said.The office has hired retired officials as temporary examiners of applications and outsourced some tasks to private companies.However, its had only 1,126 examiners as of April 1, one-third of the number working in the United States. One examiner at the Patent Office screens twice as many applications as a U.S examiner, and three times as many as a European one in 2001.Document yomshi0020030505dz5500007","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Implementation","2","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Libya","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=yomshi0020030505dz5500007&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All rights reserved.The China-Africa Business Council (CABC) was established yesterday to promote Sino-African investment and trade.The CABC is the first public-private partnership between the world's largest developing country and the continent. It was jointly established by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Chinese Government and the Society for the Promotion of the Guangcai Programme.'The project we are signing here today is a key initiative to help strengthen China-Africa economic links through promotion of Public Private Partnerships,' said Khalik Malik, UN resident co-ordinator and UNDP resident representative, at the signing ceremony.Speaking highly of China's role in South-South co-operation, Malik noted that there are challenges for China's businesses looking for accurate information when they conduct trade and investment in Africa.'The CABC was created to become a new economic mechanism which will help facilitate information sharing and access, thereby deepening Sino-African trade and investment,' he said.Driven by the private sector with public sector support, the CABC will be set up between China and six African nations - Cameroon, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania, officials said.'Political progress has been made between China and Africa within the framework of Sino-Africa Co-operation Forum during the past years,' said Wang Yue, director general of the China International Centre for Economic and Technical Exchanges (CICETE) under the Ministry of Commerce. 'Meanwhile, practical economic co-operation requires co-ordination within enterprise circles from both sides.'Different from other programmes, the CABC will let non-State-owned enterprises play an important role and 'no field limitations will be set on the co-operation between the enterprises,' Wang said.Trade between China and Africa is growing rapidly. Statistics show that the trading volume between the two soared to US$18 billion last year from US$2 billion in 1999.Officials said that China and Africa are planning to double the 2002 level to reach US$30 billion in 2006.Under the support of the UN and governments, it is crucial for the CABC programme to arouse the interest of private companies to reduce poverty through investment, said Hu Deping, vice-president of the Guangcai Programme.The programme has 14,000 non-State-owned companies as members.The CABC programme will officially be launched in January 2005 and last until the end of 2007.'If it turns out that the mechanism works well, the relevant parties involved will certainly seek a further extension,' said CICETE Director-General Wang.(Copyright 2001 by China Daily)Document CHNDLY0020041117e0bi0005m","Multisector","General Trade-Investment Organization","","Completion","3","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Africa, regional, Cameroon, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=CHNDLY0020041117e0bi0005m&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved.VANCOUVER, Aug. 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Tanzanian Royalty Exploration Corporation (AMEX: TRE / TSX: TNX) is pleased to announce that it has entered into contract negotiations with a company from the People's Republic of China (the 'PRC Company') for 13 Prospecting licenses in Tanzania.The decision to proceed directly into contract negotiations for the licenses at this stage follows the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI) with the PRC Company in May 2007. The LOI granted the PRC Company an exclusivity period of 150 days to evaluate the properties within the context of concluding option agreements that are acceptable to both parties.According to Tanzanian Royalty Chairman and CEO, Jim Sinclair, 'The Chinese have pulled out all the stops to expedite their due diligence on these licenses and they are keen to negotiate contractual arrangements for them while they assess the other licenses that are covered under the LOI.'The 13 licenses include gold properties in the Ushirombo, Lunguya, and Nyanzaga areas of Tanzania and nickel licenses in the Kagera/Kabanga nickel belt, he added.While there is no guarantee that negotiations between Tanzanian Royalty and the PRC Company will lead to the signing of any formal contracts, Sinclair emphasized that the Chinese interest in Tanzania is genuine and reflects the nation's strategy of securing long term sources of supply for key commodities such as nickel, copper, gold and other industrial metals. 'The Chinese have a long history in Tanzania but their business priorities have changed in recent years with industrial commodities leapfrogging to the forefront,' he noted.'Tanzanian Royalty's timely acquisition of its diverse asset base in one of the world's great mineral producing regions - along with the political capital it has built up in Tanzania over the years - bodes well for its future,' Sinclair commented. 'And few would argue with the supposition that the Chinese are the partners of choice in today's minerals industry.'Tanzanian Royalty Exploration Corporation is a unique, publicly-traded, financial minerals exploration company whose business strategy is to develop royalty income under partnership arrangements from its world class gold, diamond and nickel assets in the Lake Victoria Greenstone and Kabanga/Kagera Nickel Belts of Tanzania.

Furthermore, the Chinese government last year donated 250,000 U.S. dollars worth of medicines to the Senegalese side, and dispatched a group of Chinese health specialists to Senegal, who organized a training workshop on the fight against malaria.The implementation of the eight measures announced to boost assistance to Africa by Chinese President Hu Jintao during the Beijing summit is steadily underway in the country.For example, this year, China Exim Bank accorded Senegal two preferential loans totaling 99 million dollars to finance a government intranet project and the project for the reinforcement of electricity distribution lines within and around the Senegalese capital.In addition, China has issued a cancellation of several debts incurred by the Senegalese side since 1990, totaling 6 million dollars.In the education field, China had offered government scholarships to about 60 Senegalese students to study in China during the past two years, while a department for teaching the Chinese language had been launched at Dakar's Cheikh Anta Diop University in order to meet the rising demand for the Chinese language learning among the Senegalese people.As economic cooperation between the two countries continues to develop in leaps and bounds, Chinese companies are increasingly winning tenders in the country with notably a Chinese telecommunication company Huawei having won the tender for a government intranet project, while another Chinese company, Henan International Cooperation Group, had won the tender for the rehabilitation and construction of various infrastructural facilities in Dakar and Touba.Since the re-establishment of bilateral relations, over 5,500 Senegalese had acquired visas to China for studies, work, travel and business.Senegalese Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio recently said China is a true friend and the eight measures announced by President Hu Jintao during last year's China-Africa summit are beneficial to the Senegalese people.'The relations of friendship and cooperation between our two countries will be further strengthened in the future,' the minister said.

"12507","China","New Parliament Building (DUPLICATE)","2007","true","BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) - China paid for the marble and tile parliament building soaring above the crumbling homes in this former Portuguese colony, and is also promising a dam and a military hospital -- all with no strings attached.Intent on cementing ties across Africa, China is active even in impoverished Guinea-Bissau, a small nation with little industry, no oil and few exports.Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing ended a two-day visit to Guinea-Bissau on Thursday, part of a tour that includes Chad, Benin, Central African Republic, Eritrea and Mozambique. He came to Guinea-Bissau from Equatorial Guinea, Africa's third-largest oil producer, where Li agreed to forgive about US$75 million (euro57.23 million) in debt, according to state radio.In his first stop in Benin, Li promised about US$36 million (euro27.47 million) in aid as he laid the first stone for a building to facilitate Chinese economic and social development in the country.Some of the nations on the itinerary already are sources of the raw materials China's booming economy craves. Countries like Guinea-Bissau may not have much to offer today, but could a generation from now. In courting them, China has turned on its head the Western aid formula that for decades has tied public works projects to progress in good governance.'China is not like the World Bank, they don't attach all these conditions on the money,' said Edmundo Vaz, a former adviser to the Guinea-Bissau finance ministry who now runs a local bank.'The West makes us wait, but we're a poor country -- we don't have time wait,' he said.It's an especially troubling strategy for countries like France, traditionally a major power in West Africa, said Valerie Niquet, a director at France's Institute for International Relations. France has a particular interest in Chad and Central African Republic, two countries on Li's tour where stability has been undermined by violence in Sudan's Darfur, which both border.'China is not listening at all to the concerns that are being expressed by Paris on these development strategies,' she said.When asked about China's investment in countries which have a record of human rights abuses -- most notably Sudan and now, the Central African Republic, where the military is accused of setting fire to more than 2,000 homes -- Li replied curtly: 'Do you know what the meaning of human rights is? The basic meaning of human rights is survial -- and development.'Inside the marbled halls of the parliament building, security guard Feliciano Balde said his country is better served by the Chinese form of aid.'In a corrupt country, it's better to come and build something big like this where the people can come to discuss politics,' said Balde, 42, standing inside the hushed assembly hall. 'At least this is something we can see. Other countries give us money, but the politicians eat it, and so people like me never see any of it.'Africa has become a crucial part of China's growth strategy. Trade between Africa and China has grown fourfold since 2001, topping US$45 billion (euro34.34 billion) in the first 10 months of last year. At a two-day summit attended by 35 African heads of state in Beijing last fall, Chinese entrepreneurs signed deals worth US$1.9 billion (euro1.45 billion) with African governments and firms.In Africa, China has found a seemingly limitless market for its cheap goods, while in oil-rich countries like Nigeria and Angola, it is finding the natural resources it needs to sustain its fast growth.The imbalance between a superpower like China and a struggling country like Guinea-Bissau has prompted some to describe China's overtures as the latest chapter in Africa's history of exploitation.Twenty-year-old Ian Nhuqui watches a Chinese construction crew working on another gift -- a small subdivision of cinderblock homes for the country's military elite in the capital of Bissau.'It hurts me to see this. The construction is bad. It has no quality. And although the buildings are big compared to what we have, they're small compared to our sea,' he said.He's referring to the maritime treaties signed with China in recent years, which give Chinese fishing vessels access to the country's rich waters. Some say those treaties are the unofficial price for the new parliament building. It's a claim both Chinese and Guinea-Bissau officials deny, but one which former U.S. Ambassador to Guinea-Bissau John Blacken says is not far-fetched.'These buildings and things are basically tokens in return for the fishing agreements which are extremely beneficial to the Chinese,' said Blacken, who estimates that the Chinese have netted US$85 million (euro64.86 million) worth of fish in the country's waters.By contrast, the cost of the parliament building was roughly US$6 million (euro4.58 million).'What the government doesn't seem to understand is that they're being systematically robbed,' Blacken said.Guinea-Bissau Prime Minister Aristides Gomes acknowledged an imbalance of power, but argued that the government can hold its own.'It's true that we come to negotiating table from a position of weakness,' he said. 'But we can't be fearful to the point of paralysis.'What is clear is that Chinese influence has seeped deeply into the African soil.On the pavement outside the building where the Chinese and the Guinean foreign ministers met to discuss the latest building plans, 39-year-old Una Dang ekes out a living selling salted purple yam for 20 cents a serving.'I don't really understand what they're doing here,' she said, nodding toward a group of Chinese embassy officials awaiting Li. 'But why would I? My eyes are always gazing down, serving.'In her line of sight are her yams, arranged on a metal platter. She does not realize it, but the oval plate adorned with a motif of orange roses was made in China.

All Rights Reserved. No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.The Moroccan king has urged China to play an active role in encouraging all sides in the Middle East conflict to restart peace talks. At a meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, the king described the situation in the Middle East as 'sinking into a deadlock'. Jiang said that the key to the problem was the 're-establishment of the legal rights of the Palestinian nation' and that China was willing to work with the Arab nations to help maintain dialogue to resolve the situation. The following is the text of report by Liu Dongkai, entitled: 'Jiang Zemin meets with Morocco's King Mohammed VI' by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)Beijing, 5 February: Chairman Jiang Zemin met with Moroccan King Mohammed VI in the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. The leaders exchanged sincere opinions on bilateral relations and major international and regional topics of interest, and reached a broad consensus in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.Jiang Zemin warmly welcomed King Mohammed to China, and expressed his pleasure at once again seeing the King in Beijing. He said: Your excellency is the first Moroccan sovereign to visit China in the 44 years since China and Morocco established diplomatic relations, and I believe that your excellency's visit will become a milestone in Sino-Moroccan relations.Jiang Zemin gave high marks to relations between China and Morocco. He said: The friendship between China and Morocco is deep and long. In their long-term struggle to obtain their independence and be liberated, to protect their national sovereignty and dignity, and to promote world peace and development, the people of both nations have always shown each other sympathy and support. There has been sincere, friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation based on equality on matters involving economic development and construction of the nation. Today, we once more take a look backwards at history, standing here at a strategic height, and take long-term interests as our point of departure. We set the direction for the relations between our two nations in the new century. Jiang Zemin suggested that China and Morocco should continue their joint efforts on the following points:1. Establishing a long-term, stable friendly relationship of cooperation between the two nations for the future.2. Promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.3. Enhancing coordination and discussion to jointly protect the rights and interests of developing nations and protect world peace.Jiang Zemin praised Morocco's long-standing adherence to the viewpoint that there is but one China, and thanked Morocco for its support of China in the area of human rights. Jiang gave an excellent assessment of the Moroccan government and the king's hard work and successes in maintaining political stability, bringing about sustained economic growth and securing the welfare and happiness of the people, and expressed his heartfelt congratulations to Morocco on its continued progress down the road of national construction.When discussing bilateral trade relations, Jiang Zemin stressed that the Chinese government has always placed great emphasis on friendly cooperation with Morocco. He said: In recent years, both sides have enlarged the channels for cooperation on a daily basis, and diversified the forms of cooperation. This has been done to bring about positive social and economic benefits to both sides. China will work hard with Morocco on the basis of equality and mutual benefit to strongly enhance trade cooperation between the two nations, and to bring about common development.King Mohammed expressed his thanks to Jiang Zemin for the invitation to visit China and for the warm welcome he had received after arriving in Beijing. He gave fulsome praise to China's success in reform and opening, and said that in the 10 years since he had last visited China, earthshaking changes have taken place in China.King Mohammed gave a very positive assessment to the relationship between China and Morocco. He said: Relations between China and Morocco have been long and friendly, and the two nations have common viewpoints on many international issues. We have close discussions and interchanges at many international venues, and each has many experiences in economic construction which we can share and exchange. Morocco is willing to work hard with China to enhance bilateral cooperation in all areas, and to promote further development of relations between our nations.King Mohammed gave Jiang Zemin a brief introduction to his views on the Middle East problem. He said: Currently, the Middle East is sinking into a deadlock. I hope that China will play an active role in stimulating all the parties involved to quickly find a resolution, and to break through the deadlock and resume the process of negotiation.Jiang Zemin thanked the king for his summary. He emphasized that the key to the Middle East problem is a reasonable resolution of the Palestinian problem, and re-establishment of the legal rights of the Palestinian nation. Israel must return the occupied Arab territory. The principle of 'land for peace' cannot be dropped. He said that China has always firmly supported and has worked hard for the Arab nations in recovering their lost lands, and has supported the Palestinian people in recovering their legal rights as a nation, and is willing to work with the Arab nations, including Morocco, to maintain normal communications and discussions to continue to play a positive role in promoting an early resolution to the Middle East problem.Jiang Zemin expressed his approval of Morocco's constructive role and unique function as chair of the Jerusalem committee in maintaining the stability of the Middle East for the long term, and promoting the peace process.The two leaders also exchanged opinions on the fight against terrorism, Sino-African relations, the Chinese-African Cooperation Forum, and other international and regional issues.After the talks concluded, Jiang Zemin and King Mohammed VI appeared together at the signing ceremony for the 'Economic and technical cooperation agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Morocco,' and four other agreements and documents.Before the talks, Jiang Zemin formally welcomed King Mohammed VI to China.

"1916","China","TAZARA - Interest Free-loan (Duplicate of 845)","2010","false","China Injects $39 Million Into TAZARA Operations513 words12 January 201003:00 AMAll AfricaAFNWSEnglish(c) 2010 AllAfrica, All Rights ReservedJan 12, 2010 (The Times of Zambia/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE Chinese government has given the financially crippled Tanzania-Zambia Railways Authority (TAZARA) US$39 million interest-free loan to revie its operations, Communication and Transport Minister Geoffrey Lungwangwa has said.Professor Lungwangwa said part of the funds, apart from reviing operations, would be for the procurement of six new locomotive engines, four wagons and the repairing of 120 wagons.In an interview in Lusaka yesterday, Prof Lungwangwa explained that the decision to fund TAZARA was arrived at during a meeting which was held in China last month at which Zambia and Tanzania signed the 14th protocol with the Chinese government to provide US$39 million interest-free loan.Prof Lungwangwa said the funds would also be used to repair the railway line and the purchase of new equipment for the workshop aimed at bringing about efficiency in the company's operations.'I can confirm that the Chinese government has provided us with US$39 million loan and we will not pay any interest. This is good news for us and we will work towards improving the operations of the company,' he said.The minister said since the country's economy was growing, it would require a reliable railway line to match with the increased production of copper and agricultural activities in various parts of Zambia.He paid tribute to the Chinese Government for the support to Zambia's various development programmes and TAZARA in particular and that the loan would help the company operate effectively.He said a team of experts from China would soon be dispatched to work with the TAZARA management to evaluate its viability and to carry out a comprehensive study on how it could link other countries through the railway network.Prof Lungwangwa reiterated his Government's commitment to contributing to the development of the country through infrastructure development, among others.Last month Zambia, Tanzania and the Chinese governments met in China to discuss the possible funding of TAZARA.Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Li Qiangmin said he was confident the negotiating teams would reach a conclusion and reiterated his government's commitment to supporting Zambian programmes aimed at contributing to the economy.Mr Li said the financing of TAZARA was a clear testimony of the good bilateral relations that his country and Zambia have enjoyed over the years, which have continued to grow.President Rupiah Banda and his Tanzanian counterpart Jakaya Kikwete had earlier appealed to creditors to cancel TAZARA debts to rescue the railway firm from collapse.The two leaders further called on the board of directors to expedite the process of concessioning management and operations of the railway company to a competent railway enterprise from China.The railway line, built in the early 1970s through the assistance of the People's Republic of China, is seen as the icon of friendship between the three partner States, China, Tanzania and Zambia.The railway also facilitated the opening of trade links between Tanzania and other landlocked neighbouring countries.Document AFNWS00020100112e61c000gp","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Africa, regional, Tanzania, Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020100112e61c000gp&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Depending on the negotiations, other costs may be restructured or dropped,' Jairo told Reuters in a telephone interview.'If all goes according to plan, we expect to start implementation of the project in the 2011/12 financial year.'Jairo said once completed, the project was expected to considerably ease ongoing power shortages.'The technical details of the project have been worked out and the cost already done. We are making good progress in securing the loan from China's Exim Bank,' he said.He said the plant would be fuelled by natural gas from the Mnazi Bay fields in the Mtwara region. Tanzania has proven natural gas reserves of 7.5 trillion cubic feet.The Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) this month announced daily 12-hour power cuts for an unspecified period due to low water levels at hydropower dams and a shortage of fuel for thermal power generation.Tanzania depends heavily on hydropower for energy and experiences frequent power shortages during dry seasons.The International Monetary Fund cut its 2011 growth forecast for Tanzania to 6 percent from 7.2 percent in March, saying frequent power outages would hurt output while food and fuel prices could push inflation higher.Tanzania has energy demand close to 900 MW capacity, but produces less than 800 MW.Some 55 percent of the country's electricity is generated from hydro-power stations.(Editing by Jason Neely)(For more Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the top issues, visit: href='http://af.reuters.com/'>http://af.reuters.com/ [href='http://af.reuters.com/'>http://af.reuters.com/])TANZANIA-ELECTRICITY/Reuters Limited","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Tanzania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020110702e76t000jb&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved. No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.Text of report by Alvar Mwakyusa entitled 'NDC, Chinese firm in 4.8trn-shilling deal' published by Tanzanian newspaper Daily News website on 22 SeptemberAt last the National Development Corporation (NDC) has signed a 3bn US dollars (about 4.8trn shillings) joint venture agreement with China's Sichuan Hongda Group for development of Liganga iron ore and Mchuchuma coal mines [southwestern Tanzania].The two projects are so far the largest private sector led investments in the east African region.The vice-president [VP], Dr Mohamed Gharib Bilal, witnessed the historic signing ceremony in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday [21 September], noting that the projects will usher in a new era in extractive industry.'We expect the twin projects to provide more reliable electric power and unlock the country's mineral potential particularly in the extractive metallurgy,' Dr Bilal said.Adding; 'I would like to emphasize to the two parties to the venture that Tanzania looks forward to successful and expeditious implementation of the projects.'The NDC board chairman, Dr Chrisant Mzindakaya, signed the agreement with his counterpart, Mr Liu Canglong of Sichuan Hongda Group. Under the agreement, a company called Tanzania China International Mineral Resources Limited has been formed to implement the projects.The industry and trade minister, Dr Cyril Chami, said the Chinese company controls 80 per cent stake in the new firm whereas NDC remains with 20 per cent of the shares.'An article in the agreement provides, however, that NDC could increase its shares to 49 per cent after the Chinese company has recovered costs of investment,' Dr Chami explained.The VP stressed in his speech that iron ore from Liganga should lead to production of iron and steel and the ultimate growth of steel industry.He added that production of power from coal at Mchuchuma as well as iron and steel from Liganga will play a crucial role in development of key infrastructure including the Mtwara port, Mtwara-Mchuchuma/Liganga railway and power transmission lines.Upon its completion, the Mchuchuma coal-power plant is expected to generate 600MW of which 300MW will be used at the two mines with the remaining power supplied to the national grid.'I expect NDC and other relevant authorities responsible for such infrastructure will draw out a strategy and plan for action to ensure that such infrastructure is developed in a synchronized fashion so as to maximize benefits from exploitation of resources at the mines.'This will definitely make the long envisioned Mtwara corridor a reality and a bustling economic region in Tanzania,' the VP said.For his part, Dr Chami said signing of the joint venture is a big step ahead towards achieving the Tanzania Development Vision 2025 of transforming the economy from low productivity agriculture to a modern and competitive semi-industrialised economy.'Implementing the Liganga project will provide raw materials to downstream metal industries and construction sector. It will also stimulate establishment of other metal or related industries,' the minister remarked.He said iron and steel industry are one of the most energy intensive sectors but noted that with parallel implementation of the Mchuchuma project, the solution to power supply will be provided.According to Dr Mzindakaya, some 48 companies in the world had expressed interest to develop the project but it was the Chinese firm which emerged the winner.'Sichuan Hongda was selected mostly because of its competence and technology to undertake such projects,' he explained.Mr Canglong said the decision to invest in Tanzania was because of the longstanding friendship between the two countries, political stability and favourable investment climate. He said the two projects will upon completion employ some 8,000 people directly.Source: Daily News website, Dar es Salaam, in English 22 Sep 11ae7fc44cThe British Broadcasting Corporation","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Unset","","Tanzania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020110922e79m0012y&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The two-day meeting, which finished on Wednesday, was attended by over 40 delegations representing Mauritania's development partners and international institutions. Countries present included China, the United States, Germany, France and Qatar. 'On the basis of its financing needs the partners undertook to provide external assistance valued at $2.104 billion to finance Mauritania's 2008-2010 development plan,' the World Bank said in a statement. The French foreign ministry announced in a statement an extra 97.6 million euros in aid on top of the donors funds for the same 2008-2010 period. The economy of the Saharan Islamic state, which straddles Arab and black Africa, counts fish, livestock and iron ore among its main products. It also has offshore oil reserves that promise to revolutionise the economy. According to a World Food Programme study 165,000 people -- or 9 percent of the population -- depend on humanitarian assistance to survie through the toughest months of the year. The government told the donors it would step up its efforts to cut poverty. 'The government promised to continue and intensify its efforts to reduce poverty and to accelerate reforms to meet the millenium development goals and to maintain and prudent budgetary and monetary policy,' the statement said. 'It also undertook, in the framework of agreements signed with the IMF, to keep an eye on the sustainability of its external debt.' The donors encouraged the government to 'open up the transparency of the management of public funds, to reinforce the quality of public spending in order to benefit the majority of Mauritanian citizens.' They also welcomed measures taken by the new government 'in terms of eradicating the aftereffects of slavery and the return of Mauritanian refugees to establish national unity'. In August Mauritania's parliament passed a law making slavery a criminal offence punishable by up to 10 years in prison after years of lobbying by rights groups. Although banned by decree since 1981, rights groups said hundreds of thousands of Mauritanians were still enslaved, the highest proportion in a population anywhere in the world.

He was accompanied to China by his technical adviser Bertrand Belle and the director for public debt in the Ministry of Finance Brian Charlette.During the 10 years' grace period Seychelles will need to pay two per cent interest or about 500,000 rand per month which adds up to 6 million rand per year.'Within the next 24 months, the government will receive an injection of 3 million dollar budget support from China as part of a package that is comparable to the treatment we have received as part of our negotiations with commercial banks, bond holders and countries belonging to the Paris Club group,' he said in an interview yesterday.Mr Faure said the agreements for the restructuring were signed on Monday in Beijing, adding Seychelles is happy with the outcome. He noted Seychelles has a good relationship with China, which has financed through grants many of our social projects such as the Baie Lazare and Au Cap schools, the Anse Royale hospital.He noted we expect another grant soon to help build a new school at Glacis and another to refurbish the national swimming pool in readiness for the coming Indian Ocean Games.'Een though China is the second largest economy in the world, it remains a developing country and it has a principle to help other people in the world, and this is how we as a small nation are getting the money to invest in social infrastructure which help our country's development from China,' he said.Mr Faure said the reform programme includes a plan to negotiate with the countries we owe, and to cap our borrowing at a maximum of 47 million dollars per year so as to make our debts sustainable.Today the economy is on the right track and all the economic pillars are solid and will help us repay our debts, he said.Progress towards reaching a debt rescheduling agreement with India was kick started by President James Michel who has already met the country's prime minister, he said.An agreement with Abu Dhabi, which is also giving us a number of grants, is also expected to be reached soon, said Mr Faure.Source: Seychelles Nation website, Victoria, in English 21 Apr 11 ","Debt Relief","","600","Pipeline/identification","1","Debt rescheduling","Unset","","Seychelles","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020110421e74l001rx&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The two companies with a reputable international status have sought partnership with Rwanda to assemble affordable mobile handsets and tracking communication gadgets.Today, they are rolling out infrastructure, mainly partnering with existing telecom operators to change the landscape of telecommunication in this country.This week, when Chinese vice Foreign Minister in charge of African Affairs Zhai Jun, visited the country Rwanda showed his delegation on-going projects like the Conventional Centre, the Great LakesRailway project and the Bugesera International Airport and invited Chinese companies to invest in these lucrative ventures.Zhai Jun said that China would continue to provide help within the realm of Rwanda's economic and social development and promised that his government would encourage more Chinese investors to seek business opportunities in Rwanda.China has already made an economic commitment to Africa of implementing a zero-tariff up to 95 percent of products from least developed African countries which have diplomatic ties with Beijing,starting with 60 percent of the products within 2010.In Rwanda, China has granted a zero-tariff package known as 'Special Preferential Tariff Treatment' for over 44 export items. Rwanda was also recently granted the 'Approved Destination Status' which gives green light and an encouragement to Chinese people to visit Rwanda as tourists.The Rwandan private sector, therefore, should take advantage of the commitments the Chinese government has presented so far.

"2422","China","1 Billion Dollar Railway (Duplicate 2278)","2008","false","'1428 words5 September 2008Middle East Economic DigestMEEDEnglish© 2008, Emap Communications. All rights reservedWith the cost of air travel soaring, Cairo, Tripoli and Algiers are finally taking steps to overhaul their dilapidated railway infrastructure after years of underinvestmentHugh TomlinsonUnlike Saudi Arabia, where three huge projects are set to give much of the kingdom a rail connection for the first time since the Hejaz railway at the beginning of the 20th century, North Africa has a legacy of rail from colonial times.However, much of that legacy has been squandered over the subsequent decades of underinvestment, to the point where national rail networks have largely fallen into disrepair or been abandoned completely.The region’s governments have now woken up to the fact that without functioning passenger and freight links around the country, their national rail infrastructure network is in danger of being permanently consigned to history. The high cost of air travel means it is out of reach for many, and fares are rising as fuel prices soar. Rail investment is back in the spotlight.Morocco already has good rail infrastructure, and its programme to upgrade its existing network to provide high-speed links between the kingdom’s major cities will bring the network up to the best of modern standards. Tunisia too boasts impressive road and rail links between its main cities, and the small size of the country makes further upgrades relatively straight-forward, so long as there is money to invest.But in the larger states that lie between the two countries, it is a different story. The old rail networks in Libya and Algeria have fallen into disuse, while Egypt’s 5,000-kilometre network is poorly maintained and has a poor safety record.Rebuilding plansAll three countries are now trying to turn the situation around. In February, Russian Railways was awarded a contract to build a modern rail transport hub in the Algerian capital Algiers. The project covers the rebuilding and upgrading of 14 suburban stations, the dismantling of 58.5km of existing tracks and laying about 95km of new line, the electrification of 52km of track, and associated works including a 38km telecommunications system and the construction of a modern rail control centre.Libya, which has had no railway in operation since 1965 after the old narrow-gauge system fell apart in the years following the Second World War, is now capitalising on its substantial oil wealth to build a multi-billion-dollar network from the roots up.'We have no rail in Libya, not even one metre,' says one official at the government’s Railway Executive Board (REB). 'We need new railways to develop the economy of the country.'Libya’s readmission into the international community has prompted a new impetus to improve the country’s tourism infrastructure. There are plans for a railway running the entire length of Libya’s Mediterranean coast, from Tunisia to the Egyptian border.This year alone, it has taken several huge steps forward. Earlier this year, China Railway Construction (CRC) and Russian Railways were awarded the two construction packages on the $4bn high-speed rail project along Libya’s Mediterranean coast. The Chinese will build a double-track, high-speed line between Khoms and Sirte, while the Russian firm will continue the line to the country’s second city, Benghazi.CRC will also build a $1bn, 800km minerals railway running north to south between the mines near Sebha and Misurata on the coast. Once the line is complete, products will be transported rapidly and in bulk. As with the North-South railway in Saudi Arabia, the line should dramatically increase the speed and capacity of the country’s minerals export business.Improving tradeThe new network 'will improve trade links to Tunisia and Egypt and the minerals railway will improve industry in the country,' says the REB official. 'We want to bring more tourists to the country and the railway from Tripoli to Benghazi means they can travel along the coast.'The proposed extension of the high-speed track from Khoms to the capital is still in the design phase, but the REB says it hopes to issue a construction tender for this package by the end of the year. With France’s Aeroports de Paris starting work on a $1.3bn refit of Tripoli International airport, Libya is at last building an integrated transport system to support the country’s embryonic economic redevelopment and diversification plans.However, questions remain over whether Libya has sufficient engineering expertise within the country to plan and roll out this network. 'Libya, like the Gulf, has a lot of money at the moment,' says an official at one Western contractor closely involved in the North African market. 'What it has not got is the level of expertise to deliver on projects of that kind at the moment.'However, there are factors that work in Libya’s favour. 'Tripoli to Benghazi is mostly flat stony desert, so it should be fairly easy to deliver,' says the contractor. 'If they hand these projects over to foreign contractors on a turnkey basis, it is possible they could bring that expertise in.'The REB is aware of its skills shortage and has issued a tender to find an international consultant to supervise construction on each of the rail packages under way. The companies appointed will work alongside Germany’s De-Consult, which has been working closely with REB for the past four years.'We would like to bring in three consultants, one for each project: Khoms to Sirte, Sirte to Benghazi and Sebha to Misurata,' says the official.Sourcing financeThe REB hopes to appoint a separate consultant for each of the three sections of the rail project by early November. Another tender was issued in early August for the design of a 450km, high-speed line between Benghazi and Tobruk, close to the Egyptian border, which is likely to cost close to $2bn.Unlike the billions being spent across the border in Libya, Cairo has chosen to renovate existing lines rather than build new ones. However, the £E5bn ($932m) budget for this is unrealistic at a time when the cost of delivering major infrastructure projects is rising worldwide. In a sign of the times, a recent tender to overhaul the 1,300 level crossings along the Egyptian rail network is to be retendered after the bids came in substantially over budget.'The infrastructure in Egypt is in a very poor state,' says one source close to the bidding process. 'There is old equipment in use on the commuter lines and safety issues everywhere. There are 1,300 official crossings, but certainly many more than that. Egypt has a densely populated countryside down the Nile. This means you have farm traffic crossing all over the place. The cost of upgrading this is going to be huge.'Egyptian Railways (ER) and the Transport Ministry are looking around for new sources of revenue. World Bank funding of £E500m is being sought for work on the country’s signalling systems, and ER is planning to offer packages of railway stations for privatisation. A contractor buying them will be able to build commercial facilities on the surrounding land in exchange for redeveloping the stations themselves, an approach used with limited success on the Tehran Metro.There has also been talk of new, privately financed lines, including a high-speed link between Cairo and Alexandria, and one from Cairo to the Red Sea, but investors have so far shown little appetite for the proposals. Plans for a new £E3.5bn railway between Obour City and 10th of Ramadan City appear to have stalled while ER reviews the financing of the project.'The issue is how to make it attractive to investors,' says the source. 'Can they rely on traffic volumes? If they rely on the Egyptian public, they cannot raise fares high enough.'A further problem the government faces is how to develop and retain staff of sufficient quality throughout the network.'Egypt Rail employs about 80,000 staff, and drivers are only earning about $100 a month,' says the source. 'The ministry needs to raise salaries, but is faced with the same problem as in other areas: how to slim the workforce at a time when unemployment is already high, to increase the wages of those critical staff.'Algeria, Libya and Egypt will all face substantial challenges in the years ahead as they endeavour to revamp rail networks that have fallen into varying degrees of disuse and disrepair. But each has taken the first step along the way.Document MEED000020080908e4950000x''600 words3 March 2011China Daily - Hong Kong EditionCHNDHK2EnglishCopyright 2011 China Daily Information Company.

"2233","China","Magbass Sugar Complex [1980s]","2003","true","Another project the Chinese are revisiting is the Megabass Sugar Complex - the country's only sugar-producing enterprise. China helped to establish the facility, which consists of a sugar-cane farm and mill, in the 1980s and it produced a yearly output of about 6,000 tonnes a year.In January 2003, a lease contract was signed between the government and the Chinese National Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation and production is expected to start again this year.There is also long-standing and increasing interest in other areas of agriculture, such as rice technology where Sierra Leone is making progress toward meeting food production targets. In fisheries too China has a historic presence, two companies having signed contracts of mutual benefit in the mid-80s. China also cites a tractor assembly factory at a former brick works in the east of the capital as one of its big investments.But the real focus of interest is this month's opening of a trade zone in the area of the former National Workshop in the eastern Cline Town district of Freetown. The scheme has involved the specialised refurbishment of a transport depot and metal workshop by China's Henan Guoji.Fifteen or more Chinese companies are eventually to occupy the site. A number already do with activities as diverse as the manufacture of building materials, pharmaceuticals, mattress-making and garage diagnostics.However, Henan Guoji's next project, a Dollars 266m scheme to revitalise the ocean-front of Freetown's Lumley beach area is possibly the most ambitious and certainly largest development project so far planned for the country.An agreement signed with the national tourist board in May 2004 outlines a plan to build a 250-bed luxury hotel complex and conference centre, holiday apartments, town houses and a promenade. Plans in the pipeline also include the building of a mini sports stadium in the southern provincial capital of Bo.The relative boldness of China to jump in where other countries fear to tread has puzzled some commentators, not least in Sierra Leone itself, and has been the subject of speculation over a possible long-term strategic interest in oil.However, the Chinese themselves and government ministers point to a number of factors. Chief among these are the long-standing ties between the two governments, aided by the willingness of Sierra Leone to help China return from the diplomatic wilderness three decades ago. 'Bilateral relations are very good,' says Zhao Zhongqui, the Chinese embassy's economic and commercial counsellor. 'Sierra Leone helped China re-enter the United Nations in the 1970s and the Chinese people will never forget friends like these. They have supported us on many important issues,' he says.Such a relationship seems to provide the bedrock of Chinese investment with all activity appearing to be coordinated at governmental level and facilitated by an series of high-level diplomatic and trade missions. But there is also a sense of a shared understanding of developmental issues, which other countries may lack.Mr Zhongqui adds: 'Both have been developing countries, and now we are helping Sierra Leone to develop quickly to maximise prosperity. Thirty years ago China's gross domestic product per capita was lower than Sierra Leone's is now, so we understand the issues.'Of course Chinese investment does not arise purely out of political and altruistic motivation. Although much of the investment is characterised by Sierra Leoneans as high risk, there appear to be a number of factors at play. The Chinese are clearly taking advantage of a low cost base in terms of cheap basic labour and the low cost of many raw materials. This sometimes has to be weighed against the added cost of Sierra Leone's much publicised infrastructure problems.Perhaps most importantly, the Chinese appear to have a definite 'first in' approach to the different sectors in which they are interested, which has been used to leverage coveted special inducements from the government. Such an approach, combined with similar initiatives in other West African countries, allows Chinese companies an early domination of fledgling domestic and regional markets as well as certain competitive advantages on the wider international stage.'Government policy was very encouraging. We found companies at an early stage were given very preferential policies. The early bird catches the worm.'While Chinese investment is broadly welcomed in Sierra Leone, there are some reservations about the special incentives awarded Chinese companies as well as the limited training of indigenous workers and the extent to which the Chinese might be using the country as a dumping ground for cheap goods.Chris Jasabe, managing director of the Sierra Leone Export Development and Investment Corporation is one of those with concerns. 'All investors should be treated the same,' he says. The problem is that investors come in and take risks and demand concessions that might not be applicable. Then everyone else starts asking for them. We are trying to put a stop to this.' The greatest downside is Sierra Leone's reliance upon Chinese investment and what happens if renewed instability prompts a complete withdrawal.20050214S506.234Document FTFT000020050214e12e0005j'","Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","","310","Completion","3","Unset","Unset","","Sierra Leone","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=FTFT000020050214e12e0005j&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"2295","China","China-invested copper leach plant officially launched in Zambia (possible update)","2006","false","China-invested copper leach plant officially launched in Zambia363 words8 September 2006Xinhua News AgencyXNEWSEnglish(c) Copyright 2006 Xinhua News Agency KITWE (Zambia), Sept. 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa officially commissioned on Friday a copper leach plant, Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, which is capable of producing 8,000 tons of copper cathodes per annum. The leach plant, owned by three Chinese companies led by China Nonferrous Mining Corporation (CNMC), has a total investment of 15 million U.S. dollars. In his keynote address, President Mwanawasa said the launch of the plant marked another step in the long journey of friendship between Zambia and China. State-owned CNMC has invested a total of 160 million dollars since it launched three years ago the operation of the Chambishi Mine which is located in Kitwe, 400 km north of Lusaka, in the copper-rich Copperbelt province. The mine has created more than 2,000 job opportunities for the local people, said CNMC vice president Zhu Yiwu. The new leach plant, together with a acid plant which is scheduled to be put into operation later this month, will add another 300 job opportunities for local people, Zhu said. The acid plant, the Sino-Acid Products Zambia, has an investment of 5 million dollars and is capable of producing 40,000 tons of acid annually which will be supplied to the leach plant in close vicinity. Moreover, CNMC will further pump 200 million dollars into the mine to set up a copper smelter plant so as to add value to the locally excavated mine ores through downstream processing. According to Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Li Baodong, China is planning to invest more to construct a nonferrous industrial zone in Kitwe which will create tens of thousands of more employment opportunities. Li said China and Zambia have established tight relations of economic cooperation in recent years owing to the long friendship shared between the two countries. So far, more than 180 Chinese companies have invested in Zambia with a total investment of more than 300 million dollars and over 10,000 Zambians are working with these Chinese companies, Li added. China has become the third largest investor in Zambia after South Africa and Britain, according to the Zambia Investment Center.

The open wagons will be delivered in eight months.Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika, managing director of Tazara, said last week that these type of wagons are used in transporting containerised cargo and metals such as copper and manganese.Mr Mbikusita-Lewanika said Tazara urgently needs various equipment to turn it around.'These developments will complement Tazara's efforts to meet customer expectations in the delivery of quality transport services,' he said.The $5 million is part of a $40 million loan that the Chinese Government granted Tazara, through the governments of Tanzania and Zambia, under the 14th Protocol in December 2009.The signing of the supply contract follows the arrival last week of technical experts from China to assess and repair loading equipment, as part of the implementation of the 14th Protocol Agreement.Other components of the Protocol that are expected to follow include the supply of six new mainline locomotives, rehabilitation of three shunting locomotives and training of staff.Conrad Simuchile, public relations manager of Tazara, said the wagons will move cargo from the port southwards. That way, wagons earmarked for picking up copper exports from Zambia and cement from Mbeya will not be empty while travelling from the port of Dar es Salaam.To match the tonnage being transported to Dar, Tazara is looking for up to 200 containers per week to Mbeya and Kapiri-Mposhi.Currently, Tazara can move up to 100 containers to Mbeya and 100 to Kapiri-Mposhi every week. It can also transport the same volume to Dar es Salaam.Tazara is this year targeting to move 700,000 tonnes of freight and 900,000 tonnes of passenger traffic.In July this year, Tanzania, Zambia and China signed a $39.2 million (Tsh 51 billion) deal to enable Tazara to acquire six new locomotives and repair 1,200 coaches.The grant has not been fully settled. The Chinese government is said to have offered a discount on the loan, besides cancelling unspecified outstanding debt.The railway line was built between 1970 and 1975 by Tazara to serve landlocked Zambia as an alternative to rail lines via Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mozambique.Document AFNWS00020101019e6aj0016w","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan Guarantee","Unset","","Africa, regional, Tanzania, Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020101019e6aj0016w&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

In addition, the site could finally house an aluminum smelter, which is on China’s drawing board at present. The permit was awarded following a strong lobbying push on China’s part. Li Ruogu, managing director of Exim Bank, was in Conakry last October with experts from Sinohydro to examine details of the future dam which is to cost an estimated USD 1 billion.Previously, the China Aluminum Group (Chalco), which had briefly been interested in buying the alumina refinery at Friguia, said it wanted to take part in upgrading Guinea’s natural resources. In November, 2005, Chalco was awarded 21 bauxite prospecting licenses that cover a total of 10,488 sq km. and lie between the regions of Kindia, Mamou, Dalaba and Mali. Similarly in November, 2005, the deputy Chinese prime minister Jung Ju, who had turned up in Guinea, told prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo he was doing his “utmost” to see that China helped Guinea in making the most of its mining resources. According to our sources, Beijing launched its lobbying campaign in the sector after several vain attempts to buy surplus production from the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee (Alcan/Alcoa) for its plants in China.

"2381","China","ZTE wins bid for sake in Niger state telecom company (Duplicate of 122)","2001","false","'NIAMEY, No 8 (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms firm ZTE Corp made the highest offer for a majority stake in Niger's state telecoms company, Sonitel, outbidding rival France Telecom , the economy ministry said on Thursday.According to the national commission at the ministry charged with analysing the offers, ZTE bid 11.8 billion CFA francs ($16.1 million) while a consortium made up of France Telecom and Senegal's Sonatel offered 6.5 billion francs.Niger relaunched the privatisation procedure for Sonitel in September, nine months after a previous sale fell through when it failed to attract bids. Privatisation Minister Trapside Fatima said Niger would keep 34 percent after the privatisation.The landlocked former French colony, the biggest country in West Africa, has a population of 10 million.Sonitel's fixed-line network capacity is 25,000 lines. Niger said last year it wanted to boost that number to 77,000 by 2010.Shenzhen-based ZTE Corp is run by the state and is China's largest listed telecoms manufacturer. It has expanded overseas by exporting networking products, setting up joint ventures and investing in local communication operations.Earlier this year, ZTE won a tender to convert Sonitel's mobile arm to the GSM standard, making it the third mobile operator with a GSM licence along with Telecel and Celtel.The Chinese company is now set to take a 51 percent stake in both Sonitel and its mobile arm, Sahel Com, through reserved capital increases. Sonitel is currently 98 percent owned by the state and employs 1,300 people. ' 'With a $16.1m offer, Chinese telecoms firm ZTEhas won the bidding war for a majority stake in Niger's state telecoms company, Sonitel, outbidding its rival bid from the France Telecom and Senegal's Sonatel who offered just $8.86m. Previously, in August, ZTE also won a contract to convert Sonitel's mobile arm to the GSM standard, making it the third mobile operator with a GSM licence along with Telecel and Celtel.The Shenzen-based and state owned ZTE is China'slargest listed telecoms manufacturer and has embarked on an aggressive programme of expansion in developing markets by exporting networking products, establishing joint-entures and investing in local communication operations.'The African market will be our next business hub,' Li Taifong, ZTE chairman said in October last year, highlighting the opportunities as African countries are upgrading their basic telecoms infrastructure.

This is the second of the four batches of humanitarian assistance materials which the Chinese government had promised to offer for the Darfurian people since 2005, Liu said at the signing ceremony. The Chinese special representative said that his current visit to Sudan was the first one since he was appointed to the present post, which was aimed at 'getting acquainted with the Sudanese officials and listening to view points regarding the Darfur problem'. Liu said that he was 'deeply impressed' by his trip in the Darfur region on Tuesday, during which he visited the cities of Fashir and Nyala as well as three camps for displaced people. 'Due to efforts of the Sudanese government, with the help of the international community, the situation in Darfur is basically stable despite of some problems,' the Chinese envoy added. For his part, Sudan's Manibi described the hand-over ceremony as 'an important event which will promote the Sudanese-Chinese relations'. China is playing an expanding role of helping push forward the peace process in Darfur, praised the Sudanese minister, adding that we appreciate the Chinese government for its support for Sudan's development and infrastructures in general and for the humanitarian purposes in particular.

Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency) ['Humanitarian Aid From China Leaves for Sudan's Darfur' - Xinhua headline] Tianjin, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) - The fourth batch of materials for humanitarian aid worth 20m yuan (2.6m US dollars) from the Chinese government left for Sudan on Thursday from north China's port of Tianjin. The pumps, tents and blankets will arrive in Port Sudan late next month and help residents in the Darfur region improve their living conditions. The fifth batch of aid worth 40m yuan, including board-houses for at least 120 schools, generators, vehicles and pumps, will be shipped on Aug. 25 from the same Chinese port. The Chinese government pledged to offer five batches of humanitarian aid to Darfur to ease the humanitarian problems caused by conflicts in the area in western Sudan. Wang Shichun, an official in charge of foreign aid with the Ministry of Commerce, said the Chinese government had consistently strived for the solution to the Darfur issue. 'The Chinese government's basic standpoint is the early realization of peace, stability and economic reconstruction via negotiations in the Darfur region,' Wang said on Thursday at the shipping ceremony. China had sent three batches of aid, including tents, blankets, medical and agricultural equipments with a total value of 20m yuan. Mirghani Mohamed Salih, Sudanese ambassador to China, expressed thanks on behalf of the Sudanese government for the timely aid from China which helped the region's residents overcome temporary difficulties.

But it has complained that the government has continued to neglect the region since the accord.Liu Guijin, Beijing's top diplomat in charge of tackling the conflict in Sudan's restive Darfur region, said development in eastern Sudan was crucial to stability.'The situation there is generally stable and there has been some economic progress,' China's Foreign Ministry paraphrased Liu as saying at a donor's conference in Kuwait.'But this region's advantages in natural resources have yet to be truely transformed into a development advantage,' he added.China had already made 'many contributions' to developing eastern Sudan, and would now donate a further 154 million yuan to build water supplies, bridges and other infrastructure, Liu said.'China is willing to continue playing a constructive role in maintaining peace and stability in Sudan,' he added.Chinese companies are major investors in Sudan's oil, and China is Khartoum's top arms supplier, something long criticised by human rights activists and Western governments, especially because of the conflict in Darfur.But China, sensitive to criticism about its role in Sudan, has sent peacekeepers to Darfur and appointed its own special representative to the region to try and bring peace there.The conflict in Darfur flared in 2003 when mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms against the government, accusing it of neglecting the region. A series of cease-fires, negotiations and international campaigns has failed to end the fighting and law and order has collapsed in most of the region.The United Nations estimates up to 300,000 people died in the humanitarian crisis after Khartoum mobilised militias to quell the revolt. Khartoum puts the death toll at 10,000.

People's Press Printing Society Limited CHINESE President Hu Jintao arrived in Africa on Tuesday on a mission to help the world's least developed continent realise its economic, social and cultural potential. President Hu, who is expected to meet the leaders of Cameroon, Liberia, Sudan, Zambia, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique and Seychelles, will sign debt relief agreements with 33 African countries. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao did not reveal the total value of the loans to be written off, but he said that they are heavily indebted countries or are among the world's least developed nations. According to Mr Liu, China plans to double free aid and interest-free loans to African countries to help with social, cultural and public welfare projects over the next three years. Preferential loans worth $3 billion will be provided to help African countries develop infrastructure, purchase technological equipment and establish production enterprises and a 50,000-square-metre international convention centre will be built for the African Union free of charge. Mr Hu also intends to use his Africa tour to strengthen China's co-operation with African countries in human resources, agriculture, medical care, social development and education over the next three years. China plans to build general or special hospitals with 100 to 150 beds for countries that have poor medical facilities and anti-malarial medicines will be provided to 33 countries. China also aims to help African countries build a total of 100 primary schools before 2009, each of which will be able to accommodate at least 300 pupils. Refuting Western assertions that China is engaged in 'neo-colonialism' in Africa, Mr Liu pointed out that 'China's ultimate goal is to achieve common development, improve the living standards of the Chinese and the Africans and subsequently promote world peace and prosperity.' 'No African government or people have ever blamed China for practising 'neo-colonialism' in Africa,' Mr Liu noted, adding: 'Africans were once enslaved by colonists and they know better than anyone else what colonialism is all about.' South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad agreed, saying: 'There is no sinister agenda - they just realise the potential for Africa.' In South Africa, which has complained that the influx of cheap Chinese clothes could devastate the textile industry, Mr Hu will make a donation of $2.6 million as part of efforts to help the country in skills training and poverty alleviation. United States International University in Nairobi Professor Macharia Munene said that Africa's enthusiasm over its new links with China was driven in part by the terrible deals that it has received from the West. 'The Chinese are agreeing to reciprocity and that is why they look very attractive,' Mr Munene observed.

The trucks were yesterday handed over to state minister for works, Andraule Awuzu by the Chinese ambassador to Uganda, Mr. Zhang Xujiang at the ministry's headquarters at Entebbe. Jiang Li, the managing director of China Jiefang (U) Ltd. distributors of Jiefang vehicles, and the permanent secretary Charles Muganzi witnessed the hand-over. Awuzu said the trucks, to be distributed to all districts, will be used in the rehabilitation of feeder, community and urban roads. He said road rehabilitation would cover slightly over 22,000 kms of the feeder road network in the country. Awuzu thanked the Chinese Government, saying that rehabilitation of these roads will play a big role in improving the living standards of the Ugandan people. Awuzu cautioned the district leaders who are the direct beneficiaries of the grant, to put the trucks to proper use and observe timely and prompt maintenance. The ambassador said the trucks, which are produced by the first automobile factory in China, have been tested and found to be working very well in China.

"2484","China","China to cancel 1.2 billion dollars of African debt","2000","false","China to cancel 1.2 billion dollars of African debt ATTENTION - ADDS quotes /// 622 words 11 October 2000 Agence France-Presse AFPR English (Copyright 2000) BEIJING, Oct 11 (AFP) - China pledged on Wednesday to cancel 1.2 billion dollars of debt owed by African nations over the next two years and called for increased trade with the continent. Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Shi Guangsheng said the move on debt would help alleviate poverty and provide a much- needed boost to Africa's development. 'Since China is willing to make contributions to alleviate the debt burden of African countries, it will reduce and exempt debt worth 10 billion yuan owed by those heavily indebted poor countries and the least developed countries in Africa in the coming two years,' Shi said. He was speaking to some 80 African leaders representing 44 countries at the first China-African Cooperation Forum being held in Beijing. China would also continue to provide assistance of various kinds and 'gradually expand the scale of assistance as its economic development level rises and comprehensive national strength builds up,' Shi said. Chinese companies would be encouraged to invest in Africa, and Beijing would set up an Africa Human Resources Development Fund to help African nations 'train professional talents,' he said. Officials at the ministry declined to detail which countries would be eligible for debt reduction or specify the extent of African indebtedness to Beijing. The gesture was seen as a sign that China was ready to take on a donor nation role on the global stage, after years of being a major recipient of international and bilateral aid and preferential economic and financial policies. Philip Asiodu, the chief economic adviser to Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo described the Chinese initiative as 'a very significant gesture,' and urged the OECD and the London and the Paris clubs of creditor nations to follow Beijing's lead. The debt covered by China's move is a drop in the ocean compared with Africa's total debt, which is estimated at some 350 billion dollars. In recent years, Washington has proposed that Beijing increase its financial contributions to the United Nations, while Japan, a major contributor of aid and preferential loans to China, insisted in August that Beijing clarify its developmental aid program to other countries. China was the major recipient of World Bank loans for most of the 1990s and was recently removed from the list of countries eligible for preferential borrowing. Shi said China has invested in 47 African countries, while Africa has largely been a buyer of Chinese textiles and electronics equipment. According to Chinese statistics, bilateral trade with African nations totalled 6.48 billion dollars in 1999, with Chinese exports accounting for 4.1 billion dollars and African imports standing at 2.37 billion dollars. By the end of June 2000, some 480 Chinese companies had been set up in 47 African nations, with a total contractual investment of 820 million dollars, of which 530 million dollars was Chinese capital. South Africa's Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin admitted that the trade relationship between Africa and China left much to be desired. 'The trade relation between China and Africa is one of the oldest in history, but it is not strong,' he said. 'Our enterprises don't really know the markets of China and Africa.' Shi's announcement was largely seen as the highlight of the landmark summit, which has been billed as China's effort to align itself with Africa and the developing world in an effort to confront domination by the West. At the opening of the forum on Tuesday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin urged Africa to cooperate with Beijing to demand political and economic equality on the global stage and establish a 'new world order.'

Kampala, Oct 11, 2002 (New Vision/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -KAMPALA city residents who in the past have had a rough time inhaling foul vapours from nearby garbage skips should now take heart. Kampala City Council (KCC) is soon to acquire 30 new Jiefang trucks from China to collect garbage in the city. The trucks are to be purchased under a Chinese grant of 12m Yuan (US$1.5m). The Chinese ambassador to Uganda, Mr. Li Qiangmin and Minister of State for Finance, Sam Kutesa, signed an agreement yesterday under which China will finance the truck purchase. 'We continue to value your aid to the various sectors of the economy. We hope the trucks will help to keep Kampala cleaner,' Kutesa said. The mayor, John Sebaana Kizito, his deputy, Takuba Kabuye and the town clerk, Gordon Mwesigye, attended the function at the finance ministry boardroom. Sebaana said he could not believe the deal would go through, saying his team made a request to the Chinese government as a trial. He said KCC would try to make Kampala shine as the Chinese capital city, Shangai. Shangai has 23m people while Kampala has about 2m people. The ambassador said, 'I hope the trucks will make Kampala cleaner and the environment more beautiful.' KCC has about two trucks for each of its five divisions, making the collection of the 1,000 tonnes of garbage accumulated per day impossible. Kutesa said Uganda would appreciate similar assistance to other towns. Published on: Friday, 11th October, 2002 by Geoffrey Kamali Copyright New Vision.

Text of report by Joyce Namutebi and Milton Olupot entitled 'MPs allow govt to get sh48b loan' published by Ugandan newspaper The New Vision website on 5 July Parliament has allowed the government to borrow 30m dollars (about 48bn shillings) from China to improve the communication sector. The money, to be borrowed from the Export and Import Bank of China, will fund the National Data Transmission Backbone Infrastructure project. 'The purpose of the project is to improve the communication infrastructure in the country, reduce the cost of communication and improve communication within the government,' the finance minister, Ezra Suruma, told parliament on Tuesday [3 July]. Under the first phase of the project, e-government infrastructure will be established in Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja, according to the national economy committee that scrutinised the loan request. The committee added that the project would be extended to other districts by 2010. The chairman, Ibrahim Lubega Kaddunabbi, noted that through the e-government infrastructure, the flow of information to citizens would be timely and credible. He explained that district headquarters would also be connected to the Internet and information and communication access points would be established at sub-counties. However, the legislators were concerned that the government had already signed a memorandum of understanding with a Chinese contractor, M/S Huawei Tech Co. Ltd, who had started working on the project before parliament had approved the loan. They further noted that the loan terms were not in line with the National Debt Strategy and the International Development Association acceptable concession terms, which require all such loans to have a repayment period of 40 years with 10 years grace period. The loan repayment period is 40 years with a five-year grace period.

"10786","China","Traditional Medicine Practitioners (Duplicate of 14020)","2006","false","MEDICAL TEAMS WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER HELP  By Zhang Feng  551 words2 November 2006China DailyCHNDLYEnglishCopyright 2006 China Daily Information Company. All rights reserved.  China will continue to improve healthcare services in African countries by sending medical teams.  The country will continue to enhance medical services co-operation with African countries, send medical teams to countries in need, strengthen prevention and control of major infectious diseases including malaria, and train local talent, said Mao Qun'an, spokesman of the Ministry of Health.  Speaking at a press conference last month, Mao said since the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation was launched in 2000, China has made great efforts to train African doctors in traditional medicine, clinical medicine, disease prevention and control, and management of rural medical services.  Among all aspects of co-operation, medical teams have been a highlight, officials said.  According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, from April 1963 to the end of 2005, China had sent 15,000 people in medical teams to 47 African countries, offering 170 million treatments.  Currently, at least 950 doctors and nurses from different regions of the country are working in 36 African countries, Mao said.  'Chinese doctors have been welcomed by local residents. More than 600 doctors have been awarded various nation-level medals by local governments,' Mao said.  The first Chinese medical team was sent to Algeria in 1963, and it was seen off by then Premier Zhou Enlai.  Medical aid for African countries is different from other forms of economic support, said Li Wanshan, a senior official from the International Co-operation Department of the Ministry of Health.  Medical teams are jointly organized by the two sides. The teams mainly provide free services, funded by the Chinese Government.  These doctors must be good at medical treatment and foreign languages, Li said.  Generally, they work for at least two years. And the hospitals or clinics where they work almost all have poor medical equipment and a small number of doctors, and are unable to meet medical demand.  There are nearly 100 doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in Africa, offering treatments such as acupuncture.  By the middle of this October, Chinese acupuncturists in Tunisian capital Tunis had treated at least 20,000 patients over the past two years, Xinhua News Agency reported.  Acupuncture can help treat stroke sufferers for a much lower cost than western medicine, experts say.  In Tanzania, TCM has been used by Chinese medical teams for 19 years to treat 10,000 HIV/AIDS patients.  Compared with Western medicines that are usually too expensive for African people, TCM is much cheaper and sometimes more effective in treating certain diseases, said Fang Shuting, deputy director of the State Administration of TCM.  Nearly 1,000 African students have come to China to learn TCM since the 1960s.  In Africa, Chinese doctors often have to deal with diseases that have virtually disappeared in China.  For example, doctors have to treat many patients with rupture of the uterus, which is hardly seen in China nowadays, said Zhang Fengru, a Chinese doctor who worked in Morocco.  Since 1975, China has sent 109 medical teams with 1,200 doctors to Morocco. Currently, 121 Chinese doctors are working there.  On April 25, 2006, President Hu Jintao met doctors there as he visited the country and encouraged them to work harder for African people.

"10841","China","China grants 30 million Yuan Loan (duplicate)","2007","false","Oct 05, 2007 (New Era/All Africa Global Media ia COMTEX) -- The Chinese Ambassador to Namibia, Liang Yinzhu, on Tuesday leaves after serving in the country for four years. He leaves after a rich career in diplomacy in Africa. He worked as an ambassador in Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe and Namibia. New Era met him on Wednesday, and he had much to say about his time in office and commented on areas of cooperation between the two countries.Q: Could you describe the relationship between China and Namibia?A: Far as they are from each other geographically, China and Namibia established their traditional friendship in the 1960s and then made it deep rooted. When the Namibian people were struggling for independence, China stood firmly on their side and provided them with moral and material support by overcoming its own difficulties. The two countries established diplomatic relations the day after Namibia gained independence.The friendly cooperation between the two countries has ever since been developing in a steady and sound manner. In recent years, there have been frequent exchanges of high level isits, which greatly helps deepen mutual political trust and promotes cooperation in all fields with marked results.China significantly increased its assistance to Namibia and a number of projects were completed. His Excellency Hu Jintao, President of the Peoples Republic of China, pledged to provide Namibia with 1 billion yuan in concessionary loans, US$100 million in preferential export buyer's credit, 30 million yuan in grants and 30 million yuan in interest-free loans during his isit to Namibia in February this year.Also during this isit, President Jintao undertook to build two rural schools and a hospital. The two sides are now discussing the modalities of the financial assistance.Trade olume between the two countries increased rapidly and bilateral cooperation in such areas as economy, trade, jurisdiction, education, health, etc has been on the rise. More and more cities in the two countries got twinned with more commercial and cultural exchanges between the two peoples. Some Chinese businessmen came to Namibia to invest, who made contributions to enriching local markets, improving the living standards of the locals and arresting unemployment and poverty.In accordance with the MoU on the implementation plan for organised Group Travel by Chinese citizens to Namibia signed during President Jintao's isit, Chinese travel agencies will start organising tourist groups to Namibia as of October 15.In a word, acting on the Beijing Declaration and Plan of Action of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held last year, the two sides are making concerted efforts to instil igour and itality into bilateral relations, which will greatly benefit the two countries and the two peoples.

According to that special bilateral arrangement, most of the products in Malawi enjoy duty free to China. This is a unilateral preferential arrangement for Malawi, not a free trade agreement between our two countries.","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Implementation","2","Export credits","Unset","","Malawi","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNEWS00020080402e442001b9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"12109","China","Hotel construction (duplicate)","2004","false","'FT REPORT - SIERRA LEONEChina leads the way, building on ties that go back 30 years CHINESE INTEREST: Relationship can be seen in some of Freetown's architecture. Andrew Child reports.By ANDREW CHILD1108 words14 February 2005Financial TimesFTFTSurveys SIE1Page 6English(c) 2005 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reservedIn terms of business investment, it is the Chinese who appear to lead the way, with by far the most conspicuous presence of any country in Sierra Leone. Some comment that it is the only real identifiable investment thereMuch evidence of the relatively long standing nature of this interest can be found in the architecture of some of the larger buildings of Freetown, the capital. Some Chinese investment in Sierra Leone began as early as the 1970s and gradually gathered pace before the civil war prompted a withdrawal.The Chinese were convinced by the Kabbah government in 2002 to pick up where they had left off and investment gathered momentum again. Initially, this took the form of the rebuilding and refurbishment of a number of mostly Chinese-built buildings in Freetown, including the 60,000-capacity national stadium complex, the Chinese-named Youyi building housing most of the government ministries, and the army headquarters. Perhaps most symbolic, though, has been the rehabilitation of the prominent Bintumani Hotel which was occupied and partly destroyed by rebel forces during the civil war.The Beijing Urban Construction Group, which has agreed a 25-year lease with the government, completed work on the now Chinese-themed 11 acre site in December 2002. Work continues to upgrade the site with plans to build a casino there.Another project the Chinese are revisiting is the Megabass Sugar Complex - the country's only sugar-producing enterprise. China helped to establish the facility, which consists of a sugar-cane farm and mill, in the 1980s and it produced a yearly output of about 6,000 tonnes a year.In January 2003, a lease contract was signed between the government and the Chinese National Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation and production is expected to start again this year.There is also long-standing and increasing interest in other areas of agriculture, such as rice technology where Sierra Leone is making progress toward meeting food production targets. In fisheries too China has a historic presence, two companies having signed contracts of mutual benefit in the mid-80s. China also cites a tractor assembly factory at a former brick works in the east of the capital as one of its big investments.But the real focus of interest is this month's opening of a trade zone in the area of the former National Workshop in the eastern Cline Town district of Freetown. The scheme has involved the specialised refurbishment of a transport depot and metal workshop by China's Henan Guoji.Fifteen or more Chinese companies are eventually to occupy the site. A number already do with activities as diverse as the manufacture of building materials, pharmaceuticals, mattress-making and garage diagnostics.However, Henan Guoji's next project, a Dollars 266m scheme to revitalise the ocean-front of Freetown's Lumley beach area is possibly the most ambitious and certainly largest development project so far planned for the country.An agreement signed with the national tourist board in May 2004 outlines a plan to build a 250-bed luxury hotel complex and conference centre, holiday apartments, town houses and a promenade. Plans in the pipeline also include the building of a mini sports stadium in the southern provincial capital of Bo.The relative boldness of China to jump in where other countries fear to tread has puzzled some commentators, not least in Sierra Leone itself, and has been the subject of speculation over a possible long-term strategic interest in oil.However, the Chinese themselves and government ministers point to a number of factors. Chief among these are the long-standing ties between the two governments, aided by the willingness of Sierra Leone to help China return from the diplomatic wilderness three decades ago. 'Bilateral relations are very good,' says Zhao Zhongqui, the Chinese embassy's economic and commercial counsellor. 'Sierra Leone helped China re-enter the United Nations in the 1970s and the Chinese people will never forget friends like these. They have supported us on many important issues,' he says.Such a relationship seems to provide the bedrock of Chinese investment with all activity appearing to be coordinated at governmental level and facilitated by an series of high-level diplomatic and trade missions. But there is also a sense of a shared understanding of developmental issues, which other countries may lack.Mr Zhongqui adds: 'Both have been developing countries, and now we are helping Sierra Leone to develop quickly to maximise prosperity. Thirty years ago China's gross domestic product per capita was lower than Sierra Leone's is now, so we understand the issues.'Of course Chinese investment does not arise purely out of political and altruistic motivation. Although much of the investment is characterised by Sierra Leoneans as high risk, there appear to be a number of factors at play. The Chinese are clearly taking advantage of a low cost base in terms of cheap basic labour and the low cost of many raw materials. This sometimes has to be weighed against the added cost of Sierra Leone's much publicised infrastructure problems.Perhaps most importantly, the Chinese appear to have a definite 'first in' approach to the different sectors in which they are interested, which has been used to leverage coveted special inducements from the government. Such an approach, combined with similar initiatives in other West African countries, allows Chinese companies an early domination of fledgling domestic and regional markets as well as certain competitive advantages on the wider international stage.'Government policy was very encouraging. We found companies at an early stage were given very preferential policies. The early bird catches the worm.'While Chinese investment is broadly welcomed in Sierra Leone, there are some reservations about the special incentives awarded Chinese companies as well as the limited training of indigenous workers and the extent to which the Chinese might be using the country as a dumping ground for cheap goods.Chris Jasabe, managing director of the Sierra Leone Export Development and Investment Corporation is one of those with concerns. 'All investors should be treated the same,' he says. The problem is that investors come in and take risks and demand concessions that might not be applicable. Then everyone else starts asking for them. We are trying to put a stop to this.' The greatest downside is Sierra Leone's reliance upon Chinese investment and what happens if renewed instability prompts a complete withdrawal.20050214S506.234Document FTFT000020050214e12e0005j'","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Sierra Leone","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=FTFT000020050214e12e0005j&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"11472","China","Youth training centers (Duplicate)","2007","false","Chinese benefaction to Namibia in particular held steadfast on Monday when President Hu Jintao announced a N$1-billion soft loan and also offered N$60 million in the form of an interest-free loan, a grant and dozens of scholarships.Hu made the announcement in Windhoek during the fifth leg of his marathon tour of eight African countries some of which have received substantial sums of money in aid while in the same vein benefiting from debt-cancellation from the Asian giant.Hu said during talks with President Hifikepunye Pohamba that China would further avail US$100 million in buyers' credit and build youth-training centres in Namibia.Because Namibia is among the few African countries officially designated a tourism destination by the Chinese government, some of the money would go towards boosting its market share of the rapidly expanding Chinese tourism industry, particularly group tours.During the official talks on Monday that preceded the signing ceremony for the soft loans and other bilateral aid, Pohamba told his counterpart that Namibia has numerous opportunities for investment in the fields of agriculture, tourism, aquaculture, mining, energy, technology and infrastructure and human development.'In this regard, we are inviting Chinese entrepreneurs to come and form joint ventures and other business partnerships with their Namibian counterparts for the mutual benefit of both countries,' Pohamba said at the meeting held with Hu at a local hotel.He assured Chinese investors that they have nothing to fear because Namibia offers a conducive business environment in line with the Reciprocal Treaty on the Promotion and Protection of Investment signed by the two nations.China's tremendous economic and social growth, elevating it to a global economic powerhouse, was also commended by President Pohamba who said Namibia 'would like to emulate' the Asian nation's successes and learn from 'your tremendous experience'.'Namibia needs partners in the promotion and realization of industrial development, investment and local value addition which are all critical for the achievement of our national development goals as set out in our National Development Plans and Vision 2030,' the Head of State said at a meeting that included several cabinet ministers.He said the recent Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation reached common ground on major international political and economic issues, especially on the reform of the United Nations and the maintenance of international peace and security.'Namibia supports the China-Africa policy, which is based on peaceful co-existence and anchored on the values of sincerity, equality and mutual common development,' he said.And Namibia being a member of the Troika of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security, shall continue to support regional efforts aimed at conflict prevention.And equally important Pohamba reaffirmed his government's full support 'for the one-China policy and to reiterate our position that Taiwan is an integral part of China.'Hu said the cooperation between Namibia and China has been growing steadfastly in the fields of politics, economics, education, public health and culture.Since taking office in March 2005, Pohamba has actively promoted bilateral ties with China, and according to the news agency AP, trade between the two nations in the first 11 months of 2006 amounted to US$240 million, an increase of 103 percent from 2005.Hu, whose 130-strong delegation included his wife Liu Yongqing and several senior ministers and high-ranking officials, left yesterday morning for South Africa.//CHINA has offered Government one billion Namibian dollars as a concessional loan over a three-year period until 2010, plus another N$720 million as a credit line, The Namibian established yesterday.The offer was made on Monday during bilateral talks shortly before Chinese President Hu Jintao wrapped up his brief visit of barely 23 hours to Namibia yesterday morning.After talks with Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba on Monday, a new grant and an interest-free loan agreement worth N$60 million were signed at a brief public signing ceremony.The state visit culminated with a banquet held in honour of Hu and his 130-member delegation.The Permanent Secretary in the Finance Ministry confirmed the huge amount yesterday afternoon.'The N$1 billion is in the form of a concessional loan, which means that Namibia can use those funds on projects it will decide on,' Calle Schlettwein told The Namibian.'The second offer of US$ 00 million (about N$720 million) is a concessional credit line.This will enable our Government to acquire goods, services and equipment from China,' Schlettwein added.He said Government still had to decide whether it would accept the offer.'We will then have to decide on which projects we will use those funds and then negotiate the loan terms,' he explained.After Hu's departure, the two countries issued a joint communique, but the loan offer was not mentioned.Namibia and China expressed their satisfaction with the strong ties that exist between them as well as political trust and good co-operation.'Both heads of state recognised the achievements made in trade and agreed to work together to strengthen co-operation in mining, agriculture, tourism, manufacturing and human resources development,' the communique stated.Both countries now have four agreements in place: trade and economic co-operation, establishing a joint commission on trade and economic co-operation, a reciprocal treaty for the protection of trade and investments for both Chinese and Namibian businesspeople in China and Namibia.The fourth agreement was signed in Beijing last November during the Forum for China-Africa Co-operation (Focac).The Namibia Investment Centre and a similar institution in China, the China investment Promotion Agency (CIPA), agreed to promote and facilitate investment between the two countries.After Hu left, some 35 Chinese businesspeople who are part of his official delegation remained behind in Windhoek for a business presentation on Namibia as an investment destination.It was organised by the Namibia Investment Centre and the Ministry of Trade and Industry and some 50 Namibian captains of industry attended the session.Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko called on the Chinese executives to form joint ventures with their Namibian counterparts and to invest in local value addition of the country's raw materials.'It is imperative that during all your deliberations and interactions, value addition should become your central strategy of engagement,' Ngatjizeko urged.//Mar 27, 2007 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --GOVERNMENT will engage a Chinese software company to install an electronic management system for the public service.Cabinet approved that the Office of the Prime Minister could secure funding under a concessional loan agreement signed last month between China and Namibia during the state visit of Chinese president Hu Jintao for the implementation of an Electronic Documentation and Records Management System (EDRMS) across the public service.This is viewed as a critical project in terms of existing e-governance policy directives.China offered over N$1 billion as a loan for projects to be identified by Namibia.The EDRMS project team evaluated various appropriate software solutions and found that the system offered by Chinese outfit CA-China SS Software Technology would be best suited for the requirements of the Namibian public service.'The system is not only government user friendly, but also offers easy-to-use interfaces and robust application software that will link up with already familiar public service platforms to ensure records and archival compliance,' Information Minister Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah told reporters last week.Cabinet therefore endorsed the EDRMS under the auspices of the Office of the Prime Minister on condition that it complies with tender procedures.Cabinet instructed the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Commission to discuss the conditions, terms, modality of accessing the preferential loan and credit facility to finance the EDRMS and other priority projects in Namibia with the Chinese Government.Cabinet also granted approval for the arrangement of the grant and the use of the concessional loans for the EDRMS project by the Export-Import Bank of China, subject to concurrence by the Chinese Government.The company CA-CSS is a joint venture formed by New York-based commercial software associates (CA) and China National Computer Software   Technology Service Corporation (CS S).The primary goal of the joint venture was to explore the huge potential presented by the Chinese software market by leveraging the resources and expertise from both parties.The company's head office is in Beijing, China.//Bilateral trade aside, the visit to Namibia in 2007 of Chinese President Hu Jintao during his historic tour of several African countries, resulted in China offering Namibia concessional loans amounting to RMB1 billion. And it also generously extended a preferential line of credit that is interest-free to the tune of US$100 million.From the concessional loan, an amount of RMB41 million was used for the procurement of software and for the implementation of the e-governance project for Namibia, while RMB300 million was used for the procurement of X-ray equipment from China.RMB645 million from the concessional loan funded three developmental projects including for the implementation of one of the phases of the Northern Railway Line as well as the upgrading of the Oshakati State Hospital in northern Namibia, which she noted: 'was very run down and needed to be upgraded'.Part of these funds was used to give a facelift and expansion of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), whose facilities were built during the colonial era.'The Namibian side is satisfied with the implementation of these projects,' she said.She said since her deployment as Chinese Ambassador to Namibia, she has worked tirelessly to ensure that the eight areas of cooperation measures promised by President Hu Jintao at the China Africa Summit held in Beijing in 2006 such as the provision of full support to African countries, that such as assistance to rural schools and hospitals are fulfilled.'Since I came to Namibia, I have been working very hard to implement the eight measures promised by President Hu Jintao at the China-Africa Beijing Summit. Since my arrival, my job was to consolidate different relations and to further the friendship and areas of cooperation. Since my arrival, our mutual trust has grown,' she said.The eight measures announced by the Chinese president included the doubling of grant assistance and providing US$3 billion soft loans and US$2 billion preferential buyer's credit in three years setting up a China-Africa development fund which will be injected with US$5 billion to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Africa.Other measures are: building a conference centre for the African Union, cancelling debts owed by heavily indebted and the least developed African countries, further opening up China's vast market to Africa by largely increasing the number of African export items to China that receive zero-tariff treatment and strengthening cooperation in the fields of agriculture, human resource enhancement, health and education.The inception of the Forum of China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) brought tangible benefits to Namibia such as the building of the regional council buildings in Rundu and Outapi, the New State House, the fishery laboratory at Kamutjonga Inland Fisheries Institute in Kavango, the Defence Academy (Okahandja), and the Youth Training Centre.China also availed grants amounting to RMB20 million and it helped to fund a large hospital at Omuthiya where a groundbreaking ceremony has occurred.She said China has provided over 300 training opportunities to Namibians in various fields while at the same time it has seconded a medical team at the Katutura State Hospital. There are several Chinese experts working at grassroots level while rural women and youth empowerment projects have all benefited from China's generosity.At current exchange rates, US$1 is equivalent to RMB6.8.//No18, 2011 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE Ministry of Works and Transport has drawn Government into taking a Chinese loan that was rejected two years ago as 'onerous' in a road-building contract that has also bypassed official open tender process.The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, George Simataa, told The Namibian that the construction of the two roads - between Omakange and Ruacana and between Omafo and Outapi in northern Namibia - will be funded with a Chinese loan but that the Ministry of Finance is yet to apply or approve the loan. The roads are expected to cost about N$1 billion.The Namibian has it on good authority that the loan in question is the same controversial package that the Government ditched in 2009 after Teko Trading, a company owned by two Namibians and a Chinese national now facing corruption charges, was exposed as having received kic-backs of N$120 million from China when the Government bought customs scanning equipment for N$550 million.Teko Trading was said to be the 'local representative' for Nuctech (the Chinese company) although the Ministry of Finance said it had no knowledge of the company's dubious middle-man role.Teko Trading, owned by Public Service Commissioner Teckla Lameck, Kongo Mokaxwa and Chinese national Yung Fan, were supposed to be the 'local representatives' for China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export, and were experted to earn at least 10 per cent 'commission' from the N$1,1 billion tender to complete the 65km northern railway line between Ondangwa and Oshikango.Government dropped that loan agreement, with then Permanent Secretary of Finance Calle Schlettwein calling it 'onerous' and Simataa arguing in documents that the loan was 'risky because of foreign exchange fluctuations'.In a series of e-mails this week, Simataa said two Chinese firms, China Gezhouba Group International Engineering and China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export, have been selected to build the two roads mentioned earlier.While his reply on Tuesday was categorical that the two companies were selected to do the job, after he was asked to elaborate or give definite answers, on Wednesday he changed saying they still have to negotiate and agree on pricing after which they will sign technical and framework agreements.'It is only at that stage that the Ministry of Finance will be approached to apply for a loan from the Chinese Government,' Simataaa said in an e-mail on Wednesday.Asked if it is a condition of the loan that the work be given to Chinese companies he was evasive, saying 'these are Chinese-financed projects. One of their conditions is that the projects should be carried [out] by Chinese firms'.Having already gone ahead with the project, Simataa would also not say for certain whether the ministry was given tender exemption for the work, saying only that proper tender regulations were followed. When pressed if the construction of the two roads were put out on official and open tender Simataa said 'no', citing Chinese loan conditions that Chinese companies be used on the projects. Simataa and the Ministry of Works have been named in research documents as the main culprits in regularly demanding and getting exemptions from public tender regulations.It is unclear why Simataa and the ministry have decided to return to the Chinese loan that they criticised a couple of years ago. There are no indications this time that Teko Trading would be involved.The China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export northern railway line contract was cancelled after it was challenged in the High Court because of alleged tender irregularities.","Education","","110","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020070207e327000d2&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Internet Securities, Inc. All rights reserved.By David MugabeUGANDA has received malaria drugs worth $400,000 (about sh860m) from China.“Today, we get another arsenal in the fight against Africa’s number one killer–malaria,” said Richard Nduhura, the health state minister, while receiving the drugs from Chong Quan, the Chinese assistant minister of commerce.The ceremony was at the ministry of foreign affairs offices in Kampala.The drugs, ARCO and Duo-Cotexin, are a fairly new first-line malarial combination drug therapy currently in use.The drugs are, however, still awaiting pre-qualification from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to enter the “essential drugs list”, meaning that nations could start using them on a wider range.If WHO enlists them as essential drugs, then the Government can start procurement for massive public use, Nduhura said.He said the first consignment of the 150,000 single dose ARCO drugs had already arrived in the country and would be distributed free of charge at regional referral hospitals.Each dose consists of eight tablets. The Duo-Cotexin combination will arrive in May 2009.Health officials say ARCO and Duo-Cotexin are emerging as some of the most effective malarial combination drugs.Quan said his country was committed to helping Uganda. He led a delegation of government and trade officials to the first session of the joint committee on trade, investment and economic cooperation between Uganda and China.China will rehabilitate the 100-bed Naguru Health Centre and the malaria unit at Mulago Hospital, Quan said.While some steps have been taken to contain malaria like provision of free mosquito nets and increased funding, there is a huge challenge regarding ignorance surrounding cheap control measures like destroying mosquito breeding grounds.'); //-->© Copyright The New Vision 2000-2009.

"13512","China","Anti-malaria research center- included in project 716","2011","false","Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)Abidjan, 16 August: The problem of poverty is a big challenge for Africa and the fight against this scourge has been the main preoccupation of most governments on the continent.Most analysts have observed that China has been deeply involved in the fight against poverty on the continent besides African governments. China has also remained faithful on the side of the continent as witnessed in a number of initiatives that have been launched in various sectors.Among African countries, Cote d'Ioire is one of those which have benefited a lot from China's support and help.In the health sector, taking the case of malaria as an example, the means to fight against the disease have been reinforced in Cote d'Ioire thanks to Sino-Cote d'Ioire cooperation.Through collaboration with Cote d'Ioire's health ministry, the Chinese government has put up a research centre in Abidjan which will help in the fight against malaria. The Cote d'Ioire authorities have said that this malaria research centre came at the right time and it will help to improve the health status of the population.'Malaria is a real health problem in the country and it represents the first reason for medical consultations in our hospitals. A centre offered by a friendly nation (China) will help to relieve the pain of most of our people,' Patrice Konan, a doctor at a hospital in Abidjan, said in a recent interview with Xinhua.The impoverization of the people comes not only through the deterioration of health conditions, but also through food deficiency.Cote d'Ioire has also received support from China in her efforts to achieve food sufficiency through production of foodstuffs like rice.In March this year, China which is the biggest rice producer in the world gave Cote d'Ioire authorities over 200 tons of fertilizers and hundreds of agricultural machines whose cost was evaluated at 2 million euros.Still, following the appeal from Cote d'Ioire for the Chinese support on the strategies for reviing rice farming, a Chinese delegation of experts visited several Cote d'Ioire localities in 2010 to train rice farmers.The Chinese delegation in Cote d'Ioire was led by Director of the International Center for the Fight Against Poverty (LPRCC) Wu Zhing.'There's need to take advantage of the Chinese experience in order to increase food production,' a Cote d'Ioire investment expert Raymond Sibailly said recently.'The IPRCC is one of the biggest global institutions involved in the fight against poverty. This center also works with the universities of China and through its actions, this country has achieved miracles in the fight against poverty,' Sibailly said.The problem of housing is another big challenge for Cote d'Ioire. In the country, most of the people do not have decent houses to live. In most towns, there's a problem of slums which house the jobless people or those who earn little wages. Most families live in makeshift houses because of poverty.In order to help resolve the housing problem, China has partnered with the Cote d'Ioire government in the construction sector to try and reduce the housing shortage.During a recent meeting with a Chinese construction company, Cote d'Ioire Prime Minister Guillume Soro called for concerted efforts with Cote d'Ioire's Construction and Housing Company (SICOGI) to ensure that majority of the people live in decent houses.Recently Cote d'Ioire experienced a post-election crisis which resulted in the loss of lives and destruction of property. Soon after the crisis was over, the country's President Alassane Ouattara announced that reconstruction of the country would be one of his main priorities.China has expressed its willingness to help Cote d'Ioire in the reconstruction process.After several preliminary meetings with Cote d'Ioire's authorities during which the Chinese emissaries promised support from their country, Sino-Cote d'Ioire agreements regarding Chinese aid for Cote d'Ioire's post-crisis reconstruction were signed in June this year.Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhai Jun and Cote d'Ioire's Foreign Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan signed the documents which granted Cote d'Ioire loans and cancellation of Cote d'Ioire's debt.In addition, China has also given Cote d'Ioire 'urgent materials' worth 1.09 billion Fcfa.China has honoured the commitments she made to Cote d'Ioire.'The crisis increased poverty in Cote d'Ioire. The Chinese contribution is expected to help in the revial of activities in some of the country's sectors,' said Emmanuel Lohoues, an official at Cote d'Ioire's finance ministry.'On the path of development, Cote d'Ioire will always have China on her side,' Zhai promised.Chinese Ambassador to Cote d'Ioire Wei Wenhua has on several occasions reiterated his country's willingness to help Cote d'Ioire on her development path.","Health","","","Completion","3","In-kind contribution","Unset","","Cote D'Ivoire","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020110816e78g0030d&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

I hope that they can exploit the measures offered by our government to make smooth progress,' he said. Premier Jiabao was meeting President Yoweri Museveni at the Maritim Sharm el Sheikh International Congress Centre in Egypt after he announced his government's eight measure programme aimed at pushing forward China-Africa cooperation.The measures include a proposal to establish a China-Africa partnership in addressing climate change, enhancing cooperation with Africa in science and technology, help Africa build up financing capacity by providing US$10 billion dollars in concessionary loans to African countries, and support Chinese financial institutions in setting up a special loan of US$1 billion dollars for small- and medium-sized African businesses.China has also offered to open up its market to African products where it would phase in zero-tariff treatment to 95 percent of the products from the least developed African countries having diplomatic relations with China, starting with 60 percent of the products within 2010. It will also enhance cooperation with Africa in agriculture, strengthen cooperation in medical care and health, enhance cooperation in human resources development and education and expand people-to-people and cultural exchanges.The Chinese government also pledged to support Uganda's development programme including a toll road from Entebbe International Airport to Uganda's business district and capital with concessionaryloans from Exim Bank.'With regard to other projects, the Chinese government encourages Chinese investments inUganda's energy sector, infrastructure development, agro-processing and oil refinery. We understand and pay special attention to Uganda's needs of funding for such projects,' he said.President Yoweri Museveni commended the Chinese government for its support to Uganda from the time of the struggle for independence to date and said he was pleased with the efforts China was making to contribute to Africa's development.'The announcement of the eight measure programme was very welcome. In the case of soft loans, China can help support projects like the hydro-power dam on River Nile at Karuma station and the toll road done on a build and operate basis.

"14468","China","Rice irrigation project in Uganda (Commitment year too early)","1987","false","11 February 2010Kampala, Feb 11, 2010 (New Vision/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- AGNES Muyagu is a widow. With eight children to take care of single-handed, her challenges are countless. But Muyagu is not one to sit back and wallow in self-pity. She invested her energies in the production of rice in Doho Irrigation Rice Scheme (DIRS). She has a three-acre piece of land from which she reaps over 1,000kg of rice per season. There are two seasons in a year.'This irrigation scheme has helped me pay school fees for my children and provide for my family. Sometimes I wonder how life would be without it. The only challenge though, is that it demands very hard work. But I know success comes from hard work. So I am not complaining,' she says.Doho Irrigation Rice Scheme in Nampologoma village, Mazimasa sub-county in Butaleja district, has been a source of livelihood for many families in the area. Almost every family is engaged in rice farming and production.Needless to say, there is hardly any bare ground in Nampologoma village. From a distance, one may think the ground is covered with a carpet.Whether it is a road or just any bare surface, every available space is used for drying rice.In his state-of-the-nation address on New Year's Day, President Yoweri Museveni, reiterated the need for the construction of water dams to ensure that there is enough water for farming throughout the year.He also promised support for people engaged in income-generating activities under the increased household incomes (bona bagaggawale) programme. The Rice People - an organised group called Doho Rice Scheme Farmer's Association (DRSFA) with a membership of over 4,380 farmers - would fit in this programme very well.The group was formed and registered with the Government in 1993 to replace the cooperative society. Members make an annual contribution of sh20,000 that brings enormous benefits like accessibility to small loans, rent-free land in the irrigation scheme, technical services and much more.The Government provides technical support which includes maintaining and rehabilitating the irrigation system, provision of improved rice seeds and agricultural extension services to the farmers.Wilberforce Sagula, the assistant agriculture officer at Doho Irrigation Rice Scheme, says: 'From the cultivatable area of 2,380 acres, about 6,800 tonnes of rice are harvested per year. However, there is still a challenge of collective marketing. Currently each farmer harvests and individually markets their rice produce.'The farmers used to grow rice on a small scale but the yields were low due to poor management of floods and poor rice variety.The farmers also lacked rice hullers to shell and grade their rice and they used to transport their produce on bicycles to Mbale to hull and sell.With the help of the Chinese government, the Ugandan Government constructed the irrigation scheme and trained farmers in the management of floods and pests.From 1984-1996, their yields improved from subsistence production to producing over 2,000kg of milled rice per acre. And in a gesture that meant a lot for these farmers, the Government bought rice hullers for the scheme while the Chinese brought better varieties of rice that had been tested at Kibimba Irrigation Scheme. The rice grown on Doho Rice Scheme is K5, K85 and K98 which is sold as Kaiso on the local market.The story of 'The Rice People of Doho' comes a long way. In fact, rice growing in Butaleja dates way back to the 1940s. In 1976, the Chinese constructed Doho Rice Irrigation Scheme, which was completed in 1984.In 2000, Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) in conjunction with the agriculture ministry sensitised farmers to increase yields. In 2003, they trained farmers and co-opted technical staff on government payroll to oversee the scheme. Some farmers were taken for training at Kilimanjaro Agricultural Training Institute in Tanzania.Doho Rice Scheme covers an area of 2,500 acres, of which 2,380 are arable. The rest is for irrigation structures, farm roads, irrigation canals and embankments that protect the garden from flooding.The scheme is divided in blocks that are allocated to farmers on recommendation of community leaders depending on the capability of the farmer. The community leaders consider the applicant's discipline and his or her ability to work the acreage applied for.The farmers at Doho Rice Scheme sell a kilo of rice to middle men at sh1,200 in a good season to sh1,400 in a bad season. In spite of the bad farm-gate price, rice remains both a source of livelihood and food security for the people of Doho. But Wilberforce Sagula says most of the rice is lost during the hulling process because the machines are old.'They crash the rice into small pieces that cannot be sold on the market. They are also exploited by middlemen who buy the rice cheaply and sell it expensively,' says Sagula. But all said and done, children in Butaleja are not like other Ugandan children for whom rice is a delicacy, reserved for only big days like on Christmas or Idd.Document AFNWS00020100211e62b000jz","Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","","310","Completion","3","Unset","Unset","","Uganda","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020100211e62b000jz&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"15350","China","Chinese construction firm builds highway in Uganda (SBI is not a Chinese firm)","2011","false","In October 2011, Chinese construction firm SBI was working bitumen on a 152 million USD Kabale--Kisoro road project near the Rwandan and Congolese borders. The current status, flow type, and start and end dates are unknown.Just like the open market where China is chasing customers like any other trader to efforts to woe government monies, China's aggressiveness is the same. Large Chinese construction companies are in the countryside opening new highways at multi-billion dollar contracts. The Chinese construction firm, SBI rebuilt a 75-kilometer stretch of tarmac road from Fort Portal to Kasese Town just after they had completed a longer, over 100 kilometer Mbarara--Kasese Road through Bushenyi District.The construction firm is now working bitumen on a $152 million Kabale--Kisoro road project near the Rwandan and Congolese borders.Mr Kevin Chen, the CEO of a $15m digital TV investment project, Star Times, says China's aggressive drive into Africa is driven by largely two factors; the money for capital investment and the technological knowhow.'The driving force now is capital; we have the money, enough capital and because of this we have to look for investment opportunities to make more money,' says Mr Chen, adding rather brusquely; 'China is opening up and expanding. When you open up you have advantages, for a long time we were closed but now we are opening.'Because of the sudden turn-around, Chinese investors are not blind to the challenges of infrastructural inadequacies in Africa, as Mr Chen says the potholes might be a menace but not as bad and, therefore, tolerable. He, however, notes that intermittent power supplies and a high cost of fuel to run diesel engines coupled with erratic mobile telephone networks still present major obstacles.Does China care about political stability? Mr Chen says it does, especially for its investment projects.'(Political) stability is important, now it is difficult for Chinese investors to go into a country such as Libya. Uganda is much more stable.'Investment is not like trading, Chen says, but the Chinese are doing both here and elsewhere. The numbers have grown so big in a very short period of time that recently, a Chinese event was held at the five-star Kampala Serena Hotel.Pioneer Chinese investor Fang Min, who arguably opened the door for Chinese investment and trade in Uganda, is seen here as an iconic figure. Her country even honoured her on its postage stamps.When Chen begins to reel off Chinese businesses in Uganda at the snap off the finger--his countrymen are into steel rolling and are exploring investing in mineral exploration and expanding into the hospitality industry more aggressively than the cautious Fang Min.Mr Uwihanganye says China is pushing in all directions and, in his view, appeasing African governments with not only cheap credit but large construction projects.Evidence abounds to vindicate this view. The Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is housed in a gleaming six-storey block donated and constructed by China.Two new towers that will house the President's Office are nearing completion on a plot between the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) and Parliament and overlook the ministries of finance and foreign affairs. The two towers dwarf all the other buildings.In nearby Lugogo, a new hospital is nearing completion to ease the pressure on the country's only national referral hospital, Mulago.Mr Uwihanganye says government seems to have been blinded by apparent extreme Chinese generosity to put any checks. There are hardly any local partnerships between the Chinese investors and local people; they are taking all.'They are finding a culture which is too liberal, which does not require them to partner,' he says, noting that Africa has not learnt from the experiences of exploitation first by colonial invaders and later by Indian and Asian business people who invest and repatriate all their profit while keeping closed communities of their kith and kin without integrating into the local communities.But China has been willing to engage, to negotiate without putting conditions like their western rivals who put human rights and governance as key to their aid or pre-conditions they wave at their companies seeking opportunities in Africa. China is also not know for issuing sometimes distabilising advisories to its citizens venturing into Africa, a position many African leaders fancy as they battle to re-assert their authority in the post-independence era.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020111018e7ai000g3","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Implementation","2","Unset","Unset","","Uganda","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020111018e7ai000g3&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Do note that all Upstream articles are protected by copyright. Any unauthorised reproduction is strictly prohibited.China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) is currently shooting 1250 kilometres of 2D seismic on the adjoining Bilma block where the Chinese giant holds 100% of the concession, writes Barry Morgan.Although the first exploration period demands no well commitment, the seismic programme will be extended, says the Ministry of Mines   Energy's head of petroleum Ousseini Assane Boureima.Sonatrach International Exploration   Development, the overseas arm of the Algerian state-owned oil company, is also actively pursuing acreage in Niger, having snared the Kafra block in 2005.The block is adjacent to its Tafassasset permit on the Algerian side of the border.Boureima says the company plans 1500 kilometres of 2D seismic in the south towards Bilma, about 50% more than the committed volume.However, proposed co-ordinates have not been determined.Sonatrach's acreage lies north of Tenere and TG World Energy believes Kafra is an extension of the Cretaceous-Tertiary Rift basin in Algeria.TG World earlier worked closely with Sonatrach on Tenere, and its re-entry into Niger bodes well for exploration and production in the country, according to TG World chief executive Cliff James.Sonatrach is committed to spending $30 million in-country during the four-plus-four-plus-four exploration period.Although no well is required during the first four-year phase, two are due for the second. 'This adds to the momentum generally, and to those forces keeping the door open for an eventual pipeline system to the Mediterranean through Algeria,' says James.Sonatrach is already in advanced talks for Djado-1, a block contiguous with the Libyan border and believed by Niamey geologists to be extension of the prolific Mosul basin and 'very prospective'.Niamey feels it needs to tighten up further on future suitors, now preferring to offer exploration terms on a four-plus-three-plus-two basis but few stumbling blocks are thought lie in the way of Sonatrach acquiring this block in March.Hunt Oil walked away from Niger's Djado-Mosul basin in the 1990s after the play failed to excite, just as it had with Total in the 1960s.The play is higher risk than Tenere, says Nubian Consulting chief Daniel Clark-Lowes, an ex-Shell geologist and expert on North African geology who built his career in southern Libya and examined data from several operators. 'The Hunt wells were not dry. One had an oil discovery of small quantities, another had shows, while the other demonstrated oil shales, source rocks which could generate much more. So I think Djado is certainly more prospective than one might think by just looking at the test results,' he says.'But one should not conclude that more drilling will yield (any elephants) though that's what some Asian players and western mid-tiers are banking on.'Sonatrach has also carried out a study of the Tamesna block where French independent Societe de Participations Petrolieres (Petropar) drilled some dry holes in the 1960s, but has not initiated talks to acquire acreage there.Petropar's probe on what is now dubbed the Azawak block on Niger's western border also disappointed but companies may be persuaded to return, given the resurgence of interest in Mali's Iullemeden basin.Elsewhere there is little to engage suitors. No wells have been drilled in Tadarast across the border from north-western Nigeria while just one well was sunk in Dallol without a discovery, by Sun Oil in 1975.However, Niamey insists companies from Australia, Canada, the UK, Europe, China and India have contacted the Ministry for a spread of open blocks, awaiting the green light to open negotiations.Independents from Pakistan, South Africa, Nigeria and Malaysia have also shown interest in the data, which French consultant Beicip has packaged for suitors.Document UPSTRM0020070118e31j00023","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Implementation","2","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Niger","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=UPSTRM0020070118e31j00023&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Jiang's three-day visit, at the invitation of President Thabo Mbeki, is the first by a Chinese head of state. Upon arrival at the airport, Jiang said the Chinese Government has paid close attention to the development of relations between the two countries, which have been strengthened with good prospects for further expansion. Sino-South African relations have developed rapidly since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1998. More initiatives are now being negotiated on customs, health, police co-operation, taxation, merchant shipping, national defence and other fields. South Africa is China's the largest trading partner in Africa. Trade volume between China and South Africa amounted to US$1.558 billion in 1998. The total volume of investment by South Africa in China at present is about US$130 million. The two governments have signed agreements on investment protection, the establishment of joint economic and trade commission, trade and economic technical co-operation and the draft agreement on double-taxation evasion. Jiang said that he was looking forward to seeing the achievements made by the people of South Africa in nation-building and to have an in-depth discussion with South African leaders on diplomatic relations. The upcoming meeting of African foreign and economic ministers in Beijing will be discussed during this visit. The October meeting is seen by analysts as an attempt by China to boost Sino-African economic and political co-operation. Jiang is to hold talks with President Mbeki this morning and is scheduled to meet with Deputy President Jacob Zuma and former President Nelson Mandela in the afternoon. South Africa is the last leg of Jiang's two week tour, which has taken him to Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Turkey and Greece.","Multisector","Economic and technical","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","South Africa","http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=chndly0020010805dw4p003dx&cat=a&ep=ASE

The Guardian. All rights reserved.China's economic and diplomatic push into Africa has gone into overdrive this week with a seven-country tour by its premier, Wen Jiabao, to secure trade deals.After warm welcomes in Egypt, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola, Mr Wen arrived in South Africa yesterday for two days of talks on nuclear power, textile imports and regional alliances. The visits form part of what Beijing foreign policy officials have dubbed the 'year of Africa', a drive for access to the continent's natural resources to fuel China's booming economy.Mr Wen was greeted at the Tuynhuys presidential office in Cape Town with a red carpet, two lines of cabinet ministers and a South African navy brass band. It was his fifth such ceremony in as many days, with two more later this week in Tanzania and Uganda.The pomp reflected a burgeoning influence in Africa, which is rapidly catching up with that of the United States and the old colonial powers, Britain and France. Mr Wen said China's relations with Africa were based on mutual benefit and posed no threat to US interests.China's trade with the continent reached a record $39.7bn (pounds 21.5bn) last year, almost four times the figure in 2001. As ubiquitous as Chinese technicians building roads and railways are Chinese-run shops and restaurants. Schools have started teaching Mandarin and direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai are proliferating.Mr Wen, the first Chinese premier to visit South Africa in half a century, was due to sign a pact on textiles to ease a trade imbalance blamed for the loss of 25,000 South African jobs, a touchy issue that has soured feelings towards Chinese immigrants. After talks with the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, the premier was due to meet oil executives and expatriate Chinese business leaders.An accord on mining South Africa's rich uranium deposits and developing peaceful nuclear technology, with both countries sharing French-designed reactors, was also expected.Further talks are scheduled for today to cover climate change, peacekeeping and the alleviation of poverty, a sign that China's engagement has broadened beyond a hunt for raw materials.The Asian giant signalled its ambitions in January by publishing an Africa policy paper, followed by a tour of three countries by the president, Hu Jintao. In November Beijing will host a China-Africa summit that is expected to attract about 40 heads of government and state.Mr Wen's tour is a showcase of Chinese deal-making. Accords in Egypt on oil, natural gas and telecommunications were followed by a $66m loan to Ghana for a telecommunications project and hints of $600m for a hydroelectric dam. Congo was offered economic, commercial and technical cooperation. Tanzania and Uganda are expecting fresh credit lines and infrastructure projects.There was no doubting the trip's chief interest: oil. With an economy that grew by 10.3% in the first quarter of this year, China's need is ravenous. Worried by Middle Eastern instability, it wants more oil from Africa, which already accounts for up to a third of its supply.Mr Wen's visit to Angola consolidated last month's $1.4bn deal between China's state-owned giant Sinopec and the host's state-owned oil producer, Sonangol, to develop new fields. Angola recently overtook Saudi Arabia as China's biggest oil supplier.Without giving details, a joint communique said China would extend more credit and expand technical assistance for Angola's postwar reconstruction.The president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, praised the lack of preconditions. 'We hail China's pragmatism towards Angola, which has allowed us to speed up the country's reconstruction.'Watchdog groups said that was a euphemism for China turning a blind eye to the Angolan government's corruption and human rights abuses. Similar criticism has been levelled at Beijing's dealings with Sudan and Zimbabwe.Chinese diplomats say it is a matter of respecting sovereignty. Privately they add that their approach is more honest than the west's, which chides some regimes but ignores allies' abuses.guardian.co.uk/china >Sunday 18 JuneEgyptCll: 5,493Exports to china as a % of total: 2.27% Signs agreements on energy and telecoms china also agrees to %50m loan provides $10m to build an investment centreMondayGhanaCll 5.034, extremeExports to China: 3% Commits to low-interest loan of $66m.

All rights reserved.Zhejiang Gonow Auto, the manufacturer of the Gonow range of vehicles from China, has appointed a new southern African distributor and has plans to invest $10 million in South Africa to establish an assembly plant by 2013.Ruan Zaosheng, the executive director of Gonow Auto International, said yesterday the plant was likely to be set up either in Durban or Pretoria.Ruan said Gonow had established three factories outside China, in Thailand, Egypt and Iran, and its vehicles were now exported to 80 countries.Its future international market expansion involved plans to build another three assembly plants located in South America, South Africa and Poland.Ruan was speaking at the official launch of Vermillion Motor Holdings, the wholly Chinese-owned company whose six Chinese shareholders are permanent residents in South Africa, that has been appointed the distributor of the Gonow range in South Africa.Gonow was previously launched into the country in 2007 by GoNow Auto South Africa, a 100 percent empowered subsidiary of holding company Boston Super Group in Boksburg, which went into liquidation in October last year.Vermillion has been established specifically for the purpose of being a multi-brand importer/distributor of automotive product from China.Jonathan Qin, Vermillion's managing director, said yesterday the company had signed import distribution agreements with two manufacturers, Zhejiang Gonow Auto from Taizhou and Tianjin-based Tanqi Tianjin Meiya, which manufactures and markets the Meiya vehicle brand, and negotiations with several other Chinese manufacturers were taking place.The Meiya brand is also not new to the country. It was launched in the country in 2007 by McCarthy Motor Holdings (MMH), part of the listed Bidvest Group, but withdrawn from the market towards the end of 2008.Imperial Holdings and MMH subsequently established a joint venture import and distributorship company for their Chinese brands, Chery and Foton, but the venture plans to expand the Chinese brands it represents in South Africa.Qin said this was Vermillion's entry into the motor industry but the investors had diverse holdings in property, consumer goods and the mining industry.It had invested more than R20m in its operations and created about 50 jobs, excluding its dealer network.7653536Document THESTR0020100604e66400038","Manufacturing and Industry","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","South Africa","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=THESTR0020100604e66400038&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

All Rights Reserved.JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) - Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi began a two-day visit to South Africa Monday, marking 10 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Yang paid a brief courtesy visit to President Thabo Mbeki before meeting with foreign affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma in Pretoria. It was the start of a tour of Africa, where China foreign ministry officials have traditionally started the year in a sign of the importance they place on the resource-rich continent.Yang was also to visit Congo, Burundi and Ethiopia.Yang said the China-South Africa relationship is of great importance, the South African Press Association reported.Trade between South Africa, the continent's economic powerhouse and a major gold-producing country, and China reached US$240 million in the first 11 months of 2006, an increase of 34.5 percent from the previous year.Last year China's biggest bank, the state-owned Industrial   Commercial Bank of China Ltd. bought a 20 percent stake in South Africa's biggest lender, Standard Bank Group Ltd. in one of China's biggest foreign corporate acquisitions to date.Chinese investments into South Africa amount to US$130 million, mostly in a chromium mine while South African investments in China stand at about US$400 million including investments by Anglo American, SAB Miller and a US$120 million investment by a property group.Yang's visit comes a year after Chinese President Hu Jintao visited South Africa in early 2007.South Africa and China on Monday established a diplomatic mechanism to enhance political, economic and trade relations.Yang and Dlamini Zuma were also expected to discuss co-operation between the two countries in international affairs as well as Chinese support for peacekeeping operations in Africa.7Document APRS000020080107e41700378","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","South Africa","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=APRS000020080107e41700378&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The two countries will 'explore ways to enhance capacity building in mining, construction and other industries' according to the communique, issued during a visit to the Chinese capital by South African Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.   In June, Beijing launched the $5 billion China-Africa Development Fund, with initial capital of $1 billion, to help finance Chinese investments in Africa, part of Beijing's pledge to double its aid to the continent.   Beijing is increasingly using its massive foreign reserves to lend to Africa, paving the way for its state-owned firms to bid on mining and infrastructure projects as it tries to secure raw materials supply for its booming economy.   The countries also agreed to expand exchanges and cooperation in a variety of fields, particularly aquaculture and agricultural products. China increased the number of scholarships offered to South African students.   'The Chinese side noted with appreciation the position taken by South Africa and other countries, against Taiwan's bid for U.N. membership during the 62nd session of the U.N.

"16709","China","High-speed Rail link [nothing was signed...not a project]","2010","false","In 2010, China Railway Group signed an MoU with Standard BankTalks have begun between the government and China Railway Group on the feasibility of the project.China Railway chairman Li Changjin said discussions were at an early stage and no funding was in place. Li was speaking on the sidelines of the China-Africa investment forum in Beijing, to which President Jacob Zuma is leading a delegation of 13 ministers.Martyn Davies, the chief executive of Frontier Advisory, said yesterday the high-speed railway link was 'very viable', depending on how the project was structured.Erik Larsen, a spokesman for Standard Bank, said a memorandum of understanding signed with China Railway, which was announced yesterday, did not relate to any specific project, but was a general undertaking between Standard Bank and China Railway to cooperate across a broad spectrum of opportunities.Davies said although it was premature to talk about the details, Standard Bank was positioning itself as the preferred financier for the project.The Industrial   Commercial Bank of China holds a 20 per cent stake in Johannesburg-based Standard Bank.Li said South Africa was hoping that Chinese state-owned banks could provide loans for the project. China Railway wants South Africa to contribute 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the capital, he said.Davies said South Africa needed to look at how to integrate the economy through infrastructure development, which the Chinese had been doing through a significant roll-out of high speed trains. China was looking to take its technology global, Davies said.The New York Times reported earlier that China intended to link its own provincial capitals with bullet trains and was also building high-speed rail routes in Turkey, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.Henk Langenhoven, a senior economist at the SA Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, said the precedent was that if the Chinese financed a project, they would also build it, excluding the local construction and engineering sector.He said the biggest benefit to the South African economy was the financing because the country 'did not have big financial muscle behind the construction industry, which is a uniform problem in Africa'.Langenhoven said many technical details on the project were not known but if the principle was to move freight from road to rail it was sound.Phillip Taaibosch, the general secretary of the SA National Taxi Council (Santaco), said the taxi industry was not opposed to the project, provided the industry was engaged.'With the diversification programme within Santaco, we are very open to discussions to see how we can participate in programmes of this nature that will benefit taxi operators who use long haul routes.'He said 'a fairly high proportion' of Santaco's members operated on the route.Taaibosch said the reason for the taxi industry's negative response to bus rapid transit systems was that the industry was not approached in a way that allowed it to 'play a pivotal role in the discussions'.Passenger volumes on trains between Johannesburg and Durban are about 270,000 people a year, meaning that a high-speed train service would also target business travellers and holidaymakers who fly. About 2.7 million people fly between Durban and Johannesburg each year.Gidon Novick, the joint chief executive of Comair and kulula.com, its low-cost division, said a high-speed train was 'very much a pie in the sky concept'.He added that the government had spent about R20bn on upgrading airports and building the new airport in Durba n and it would want to recoup that investment.Source: Business Report website, Johannesburg, in English 25 Aug 10ac7985ddDocument BBCAP00020100825e68p001jm193 words9 September 2010New Zealand Transport Intelligence BriefingTMRTNLEnglish(c) 2010 The Main Report Publications LtdBloomberg 02/09/2010. South Africa signed a memorandum of understanding with China to improve the African nation's railway services, the Department of Transport says. The Department of Transport and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa plan to spend 95bn rand ($13bn) on buying new stock over the next 18 years, Director-General George Mahlalela told reporters in Johannesburg. The department will seek approval for the spending at a Cabinet meeting this month, he says. 'The challenge we are facing is that most of our commuter- rail system has reached the end of its lifespan,' Mahlalela says.'We believe that an ambitious program of introducing new rail stock and technology in our system is an absolute necessity and will protect our historical investment in the sector.' From October, South Africa will investigate whether there is enough demand to justify the construction of a high-speed railway link between Johannesburg, the commercial hub, and the eastern port city of Durban, according to Mahlalela.

"17675","China","China to Bail Out Ailing Zimbabwean Parastatals","2004","false","On November 19, 2004, In the framework of his economy policy for 2005/6, Zimbabwean Acting Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa announced that China will play a key role in propping up Zimbabwe's ailing parastatals. Zimbabwe foresees 'ceding control' over most of its loss-making parastatals to China, but will also receive loans for the rehabilitation of others. Both countries have recently signed an investment agreement to underpin this support (see Zimbabwe: 4 November 2004: 'Look East' Investment Agreement BetweenZimbabwe and China).Significance: A number of Zimbabwe's parastatals are in a decrepit state, brought down by foreign-exchange shortages and, probably more importantly, outright mismanagement, and continue to be a drain on public resources (see Zimbabwe: 9 November 2004: Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe GovernorCriticisesGovernment ExpendituresonParastatals). This formal announcement indicates that the cash-strapped Zimbabwean government is running out of room to manoeuvre. For President Robert Mugabe's regime, the Chinese support - driven by China's need to ensure access to commodities, but also its search of markets for its manufactured goods - is more than welcome. China's government has less issues with governance and human rights concerns, to the extent that it is willing to supply Zimbabwe with weapons (see Zimbabwe: 1 November 2004: Zimbabwe to Swap Weapons for Market Access with China?). Moreover, China has the economic means to easily give Zimbabwe the financial support needed. However, its growing presence in Zimbabwe has not been met with a warm welcome from Zimbabwe's manufacturers, who have been priced out of the market (see Zimbabwe: 21 September 2004: Zimbabwe's 'Look East' Policy Meets with Local Resistance). The Confederation of Zimbabwe states that 40 companies have closed down after losing their market share to Chinese competition.Document WDAN000020041119e0bj0002o","Government and Social Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020041119e0bj0002o&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"18793","China","Zimbabwe to Import Fertiliser from China","2006","false","The Zimbabwe government will import around 387,000 tons of fertiliser from China to narrow the gap in the domestic market. Zimbabwe, which has been self-sufficient in fertiliser production during the past, has secured a US$490 million loan facility from China in recent weeks, of which US$200 million is earmarked for agro-support (see Zimbabwe: 14 September 2006: ). The loan facility will not only be used to import fertiliser but will also be directed towards the payment for agricultural equipment, chemicals and other critical requirements. The shipment is expected to reach Zimbabwe in early October 2006.Significance: Although Zimbabwe received more than adequate rainfall during the 2005/2006 agricultural season, the country remained dependant on grain and maize imports to supply in the domestic demand of the country.The below-average agricultural year was the result of severe shortages in foreign exchange that increases the lack of much needed agricultural inputs such as fertiliser and fuel. The latest financing secured by the Zimbabwe government, the first since the controversial land reform programme was introduced in 2000, could alleviate some of the demand pressures for fertilisers. It remains to be seen if the necessary input will reach farmers in time to ensure a better harvest, especially in the tobacco sector, this year.Document WDAN000020060928e29s00039","Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","","310","Implementation","2","Unset","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020060928e29s00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"18897","China","China pledges over $3B in loans to Zimbabwe","2006","false","UN Food Agency to Scale Back Aid to Zimbabwe, as China Steps InKissy Agyeman423 words15 November 2006Global Insight Daily AnalysisWDANEnglishCopyright 2006, Global Insight Limited. All Rights Reserved.As Zimbabwe approaches its lean season—when the previous year's harvest runs low and the current year's harvest is not yet in—the prospect of food shortages is becoming a grave reality for an estimated 1.4 million Zimbabweans. The UN’s food agency, the World Food Programme (WFP), announced earlier this week that it will have to scale back the amount of aid it gives to the Zimbabwean population because donor funding is at an all-time low. The low levels of donor assistance are being attributed to the fact that the Zimbabwean authorities have repeatedly announced that the country can indeed take care of its food shortages, while expecting bumper crops in the November harvest (see Zimbabwe: 12 October 2006: ). However, the WPF has announced that of the 65,000 tonnes of grain necessary to sustain the population, only 39,000 tonnes could be provided because of a shortage of funds.According to an aid agency based in Zimbabwe, Christian Care, the situation continues to look bleak and the places worst affected are the arid areas situated in the region of Lowveld in Masvingo province, Matabeleland North, and Matabeland South. It has been predicted that rampant inflation will cause the number of those in dire need of food assistance to increase to 2 million in the near future. This announcement comes at a time when the Chinese authorities have pledged to disburse US$3 billion inpreferential loans to Zimbabwe. Significance: It is feared that a general decline in agricultural productivity across the whole of southern Africa will occur in the not-too-distant future, fuelled by several factors, including the scarcity of resources, hampering countries’ abilities to purchase various inputs such as fertiliser. Also, deforestation, land degradation, and climate change pose a significant threat to food security. For Zimbabwe, however, the situation may be alleviated by the Chinese government's pledge to disburse US$3 billion in preferential loans to Zimbabwe, following the caucus which took place in Beijing last week. China has also despatched some 22,000 tonnes of fertiliser to Zimbabwe, which is said to be the first shipment of its kind, out of an estimated 200,000 tonnes. Therefore, with China offering the chance to form a 'strategic partnership' with Zimbabwe, there could be a shift in the traditional axis of support for the country, with more emphasis being placed on the 'Look East' policy as a remedy to poverty.Document WDAN000020061115e2bf0002o","Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","","310","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020061115e2bf0002o&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"18982","China","Zimbabwe, China to Negotiate Us$2bn Deal","2006","false","Harare, Dec 22, 2006 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --ZIMBABWE and China will soon open negotiations for a US$2 billion loan facility to help stabilise the economy, Zimbabwe's Ambassador to China, Mr Chris Mutsvangwa, said yesterday.'China's government is ready to negotiate with the Government for a US$2 billion loan facility to help it fight inflation and other aspects of the economy,' said Ambassador Mutsvangwa.He said the Chinese government had appointed a project officer to handle the matter and would soon start talks with Finance Minister Cde Herbert Murerwa and Reserve Bank Governor Dr Gideon Gono.Cde Mutsvangwa said this at a ceremony in Harare at which the Chinese government handed over more than 22 000 metric tonnes of compound D fertilizer for Zimbabwe's agricultural sector.He said China's assistance to Zimbabwe would help to dispel the myth perpetuated by the United States and Europe that the country's economy has collapsed beyond redemption.In a speech read on her behalf by Cde Murerwa, Vice President Joice Mujuru commended the Chinese government for its concerted efforts and support aimed at stabilising and expanding Zimbabwe's productive base.'The support being extended to us by the People's Republic of China is critical as it comes at a time when we have embarked on an agricultural revival programme.'The timely delivery of agricultural inputs and good rains we are receiving will ensure the achievement of the projected growth rate of 9,4 percent in the agriculture sector in 2007,' said Cde Mujuru.The fertilizer consignment was procured under the US$200 million buyers credit loan facility from the Export and Import Bank of China.Cde Mujuru said the facility demonstrated the strong multi-faceted bilateral relations that existed between the two countries.She said the bilateral relations which date back to the days of the liberation struggle were now bearing fruit in several areas of economic co-operation.Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Yuan Nansheng said the fertilizer was the first consignment shipped from China to Africa following the Sino-African Summit held in Beijing last month.'What we see here is only a small part of the whole consignment. I do hope that those goods will work best for the current agricultural season in Zimbabwe,' said Mr Yuan.He said he was delighted that Sino-Zimbabwe trade and economic co-operation were growing at a fast rate.'Those scopes of co-operation are expanding constantly. Gratifying achievements have been made in the fields of trade, investment and contracting between our two countries.'All these have laid a very solid foundation for the further development of our economic and trade relations,' he said.Mr Yuan said the win-win economic and trade relations between China and Zimbabwe would serve as a strong driving force for common development and shared prosperity.Document AFNWS00020061222e2cm000hm","Government and Social Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020061222e2cm000hm&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

They are now on their way home. In an interview on the sidelines of the China International Travel Mart, Zimbabwe's Ambassador to China, Cde Frederick Shava, said the consignment was the last batch of equipment procured from a US$200 million Chinese government loan.'As we are speaking, the consignment is now on the high seas on its way home. The consignment includes 1 000 tractors, combine harvesters, generators and planters plus several other related equipment. 'The generators in particular, will alleviate electricity outages in irrigation areas where we plant out winter crops,' said Cde Shava. He said although the equipment will arrive home way into the summer farming season, it was important to note that the equipment could not be shipped until the Government sent inspectors for compliance purposes.'The equipment might get home way into the summer farming season but we are sure that it is compliant to our needs because our inspectors who came here recently approved the consignment after carrying out tests. 'The pre-shipment team had to come first to inspect the equipment. By the end of November or beginning of December, we should see the consignment starting to arrive home but by mid-farming season, the entire consignment should have landed home.'Our winter farming season should be different from the previous one, as we have moved to alleviate power outages,' Cde Shava said.All Africa Global MediaDocument AFNWS00020071102e3b20008f","Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","","310","Unset","","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020071102e3b20008f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The scope of work entails construction of two berths, dredging of entrance channel and creation of a container stacking yard among many other things,' he said. The study indicated that the two more berths would increase efficiency of Dar es Salaam Port.The improvement to entrance channel and associated structure would allow entry of large vessels. 'The project is estimated to cost 524 million US dollars. However, the negotiation on project finances between the government of Tanzania and the China Exim bank are in progress, ' said the DG.'This is after submission of an official application by the government of Tanzania to the Exim Bank of China for concessional loan to finance construction of the project,' he added.

"636","China","Building Processing Factories and Providing technical and management training","2006","true","BEIJING, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Resources cooperation between China and Africa will help Africa to realize sustainable development, Chinese experts on African studies told Xinhua in recent interviews. In a policy paper aimed at strengthening its ties with Africa, China is working to explore the prospect of Sino-African cooperation in 30 concrete fields. In China's first-ever African Policy Paper released here Thursday, China highlighted its readiness to facilitate information sharing and cooperation with Africa in resources development. 'To translate Africa's advantages in resources to competitive strength, and to realize sustainable development in Africa is our aim in the resources cooperation,' said Wang Yingying, a researcher on African studies with the China Institute of International Studies. Despite their remarkable economic growth in recent years, African countries are still vulnerable in their economy as the majority of their exports are unprocessed raw materials, Wang said. China has helped African countries build processing factories and provided technical and management training courses in a bid to increase the added value of their exported commodities, thus increasing the competitiveness of their products. The Chinese government encourages and supports competent Chinese enterprises to cooperate with African nations in developing and exploiting rationally their resources. 'While the Chinese enterprises are involved in resources exploitation in Africa, they contribute to the continent's development at the same time,' Wang said. Elaborating her viewpoint, she said that China refunds the profits it has earned by reinvesting in infrastructure construction such as building power stations. 'The investment has brought real benefits to people in Africa and the continent as a whole,' the researcher said. 'Unlike some western countries, China's cooperation with African countries is based on boosting sustainable development in Africa,' Wang said. While developing oil, iron ore and mineral resources in Africa, China pays much attention to protection of local environment, she said, adding, 'We also help train personnel in various fields in an effort to guarantee sustainable development in Africa.' An Yongyu, president of the China Society for African Studies, said China sticks to a policy of sustainable development. Consequently, it lays stress on sustainable reproduction of resources in its cooperation with African countries. For example, An said, when exploiting forest resources in Gabon, China adopted a method of planting saplings at the same time to make it renewable. Currently, many African-made products are sold 'cheaply' due to their unfavorable position on the world market, causing huge losses to these countries. In energy cooperation with African countries, China purchased their products at a reasonable price in international market in stead of forcing prices down, said An, who used to serve as former Chinese ambassador to several African countries. 'These examples show that China does attach importance to sustainable development in Africa,' An said.

After holding discussions with Chinese Vice-chairman of Foreign Affairs Committee in the National People's Congress Ji Peiding, Meles said the trade and investment cooperation of the two countries should further be strengthened. Ethiopia had exported various agricultural products to China last year at zero-tariff opportunity offered by the Chinese government, Meles said. The Ethio-Chinese bilateral relations have reached to higher level presently, he said adding that the ever-growing bilateral ties of the two sisterly countries should be intensified. The participation of the Chinese entrepreneurs in development of infrastructure in the country has been increasing from time to time, the spokesperson of the ministry said. Briefing journalists after the discussion Peiding said the Ethio-Chinese bilateral ties has reached to a higher level. Meanwhile, Speaker of the House of Federation said that the economic cooperation between Ethiopia and China has been expanding. Receiving a Chinese delegation led by Mr. Ji Peiding, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Standing Committee of the National Peoples' Congress (NPC) yesterday, Degife Bula said that the volume of trade and investment between the two countries is encouraging. Ethiopia is looking forward to see more Chinese investors to invest in Ethiopia, he said. Degife said Ethiopians have a lot to learn from Chinese people success stories in their fight against poverty, backwardness and nation-building in general. The Speaker expressed the desire and profound hope of the Ethiopian people that the existing excellent political and diplomatic relations between the two countries be backed by solid economic interdependence. Mr. Ji Peiding on his part said that the two countries should add extra efforts with a view to further strengthening the existing Ethio-Chinese economic relation.

"958","China","Chinese firms have invested more than $70 million (Not project level)","2007","true","(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones   Company, Inc.) BEIJING -- An attack that killed nine Chinese oil workers in Ethiopia's desolate Ogaden Desert has provided a bloody reminder that China's world-wide pursuit of raw materials has taken it into some rough neighborhoods -- and that goodwill proclamations may not be enough to avoid getting caught up in local conflicts. Exposure to the military and political struggles that convulse Africa is one of the prices this fast-developing country is paying for its growing power and profile on the world stage. It is a new sensation for most Chinese, who are used to considering their country an economic actor that, unlike traditional powers, avoids interference in the domestic affairs of other nations. The nine Chinese were among 74 people reported killed shortly after dawn Tuesday in the desert of eastern Ethiopia. In addition, Chinese authorities said, seven Chinese oil technicians were kidnapped by the ethnic-Somali rebels who launched the raid. [But the group said it is only holding six Chinese workers, according to an Associated Press report on Thursday.] The captives joined a growing list. Already this year, 16 Chinese oil workers have been kidnapped in Nigeria and a Chinese engineer was killed and another injured in Kenya. The questions facing Chinese President Hu Jintao's government are twofold: how to better protect the four million Chinese working abroad and how to preserve the growing value of Chinese investments in places such as Ethiopia, where governments face instability. [On Thursday, China said it won't stop investing in Africa but plans to boost security measures, the AP reported.] 'China now faces the dilemma of any country that undertakes an active foreign policy, particularly one with a foreign policy in no small part based on the acquisition of resources,' said an analysis by Stratfor, a security-consulting firm based in Austin, Texas. 'It must now decide how much to get involved in other countries' internal security issues.' He Wenping, head of Africa studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said safety issues were becoming increasingly important as the number of Chinese working abroad multiplies. Ms. He suggested to Beijing's Global Times newspaper Wednesday that Chinese companies evaluate the security situation before starting a project abroad. This is a sensitive political issue here. The Chinese public seems increasingly to demand that compatriots abroad be taken care of, even as the government expresses a determination to avoid involvement in local conflicts. Moreover, the urge to prop up endangered governments to preserve Chinese investments would go against its long tradition of noninterference. Reflecting the sensitivities, Communist Party censors sought Wednesday to limit comment on Internet sites about the killings in Ethiopia, according to site operators. But some telling observations got through the filters. 'If you want to make money there, why wouldn't you send your own troops to provide security?' one contributor wrote. 'It seems we should learn from the early colonial powers.' The Foreign Ministry, however, has long contended that China's economic activities in Africa are designed to benefit African countries and that China has no stake in the local political situation. Chinese officials repeatedly have said they have no desire to repeat the exploitative policies of colonial powers, which subjugated Africa to serve as a reliable source of raw materials and a market for exports. This was a major theme of a China-Africa summit in Beijing in November, when nearly 50 African heads of state and ministers gathered to proclaim friendship with China and discuss investment and aid. It also has been a major theme for Chinese leaders on frequent visits to Africa, including Mr. Hu's tour of eight countries in February. The pledge was repeated this week by Jia Qinglin, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, shown on the front pages of official newspapers Tuesday -- the day of the Ethiopia attack -- being greeted by dancing women on arrival in Kenya. 'Chinese economic activities in African countries are on the basis of cooperation and friendship,' said Liu Lide, a retired ambassador who spent 22 years as a Chinese envoy in Africa. 'That's the context in which we encourage Chinese companies to go to Africa and invest. We want to work not only with African governments but also with African people, particularly businessmen.' As China's economic footprint grows, however, its policies have brought increasing criticism from African opposition groups that contend China's noninterventionism props up unpopular governments. In Tuesday's attack, the target was an exploratory drilling site run by a subsidiary of the China Petroleum   Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec that has operations in a dozen countries. The oil field was guarded by a 100-strong contingent of Ethiopian soldiers. China was Ethiopia's largest trading partner in 2006, with $450 million in exchanges. Chinese firms have invested more than $70 million in Ethiopia, and Beijing has provided road- and school-construction aid. 'These people had bad intentions,' said Mr. Liu, the former ambassador, speaking of the rebels who carried out the attack. 'Their goal was to sabotage China's relations with the Ethiopian government.'

"1477","China","Vocational training school [duplicate of ID#1734]","2002","true"," Jun 19, 2002 (Ghanaian Chronicle/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) - THE CHINESE government has donated an amount of $8million (about o56million) to the Dangbe East constituency to build a hospital. They are also going to help in the construction of some portions of the Accra-Kumasi road. This was disclosed in Accra when China's vice Minister for Foreign Affairs in charge of Africa, H.E Yang Wenchang, held bilateral talks with Ghana's deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Alhaji Mustapha Ali Idris. Hon. Ali Idris expressed satisfaction on the excellent bilateral relations between Ghana and China which was established four decades ago and which has been characterised in recent times by the visits of the vice president, Mr Jinn Jintao, in January 1999. He stated that the minister's visit is an illustration of the continued desire of both countries to strengthen their bonds of friendship. China financed a vocational school located in Dansoman, but it is unclear what the commitment year was, how much the project cost, and when the project was completed. The Afife Irrigation project, the National Theatre in Accra, construction of new housing units at police and military barracks and Dangbe East district hospital and vocational training school at Dansoman are all examples of Chinese projects from which Ghana has benefited. The deputy minister further expressed gratitude to the Chinese government on the cancellation of debts owed to China arising from loans given to Ghana from 1972 to 1998 and also the agreement in principle to provide financial support for the construction of 17.6 kilometre two-way lane and 40.5 kilometre dual carriage portions of the Accra-Kumasi road within three years. Explaining the NEPAD initiative to the vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, the minister said it is about Ghana's efforts to strengthen peace and security with good governance through NEPAD and efforts by the leaders of the sub-region to achieve a meaningful and sustainable development. He commended China for her contribution to Africa's development and hoped that the establishment of the Sino-Africa conference will offer more opportunities for Africa and China to continue to consult in the interest of concerted action aimed at addressing the wide range of issues of mutual concern and deepening the solidarity which is essential for addressing the common challenges presented by globalisation. The Chinese foreign minister on his part said Ghana is one of the sub-saharan countries to welcome China, with the leaders having a very profound relationship between them. He continued that despite the leadership changes, their relationship is still very cordial in the sense that their assistance to Ghana will not change because it is not directed to a particular government but to the people of Ghana. The foreign minister re-assured that the Chinese government is ready to work with the Kufuor administration since Ghana and China are all developing countries. He supported the NEPAD initiative and the preparedness of his government to join in its implementation. He hinted that a certain amount of money has been given to the Ghana government but the amount was however not known. by Linda Akrasi Copyright Ghanaian Chronicle.

We're talking to potential companies right now, but I can't give you too many details,' Feng Guiquan, a senior vice-president at Minmetals, told Reuters in Taipei.China and Mauritania already have some trade and investment ties in iron ore.China, which buys the bulk of its iron ore and concentrates from Australia, Brazil and India, imported 1.9 million tonnes of the raw material from Mauritania between January and April, nearly double the level in the same period a year earlier. [ID:nSHA70770]Minmetals has a joint venture with Mauritania's state-owned Societe Nationale Industrielle et Miniere (SNIM), which is the world's seventh-largest supplier of iron ore.Other than iron ore in Africa, Minmetals President Zhou Zhongshu last year said the company, which posted sales of 180.9 billion yuan ($27 billion) last year, was also looking at chromium in South Africa and bauxite in the Caribbean.'We are not ruling out Australia as well if there are other opportunities, although we are not in a hurry,' Feng said.'Sometimes things can get complicated when there are corporate interests or political considerations involved in such deals,' he said.China's state-owned metals conglomerate Chinalco suffered a major setback last week when Rio Tinto spurned its planned $19.5 billion investment in favour of a tie-up with BHP Billiton . [ID:nSYD73514]But Minmetals was more fortunate.Earlier in the day, shareholders in Australian miner OZ Minerals approved Minmetals' sweetened $1.4 billion deal to purchase most of the indebted miner's assets. [ID:nSP488757]'That's good news,' Feng said. 'We'e already settled our funding. Part of it will come from our own capital, while the rest will be from banks.'(Additional reporting by Lin Miao-jung; Editing by Chris Lewis)MINMETALS/ (UPDATE 1, INTERVIEW)|LANGEN|Table|ABN|E|RBN|Z|C|MTL|GRO|SOF|AUF|AFN|BNXDocument LBA0000020090611e56b000j2","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Housing","","Completion","3","Export credits","Unset","","Mauritania","http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=LBA0000020090611e56b000j2&cat=a&ep=ASE

The goal of the meeting was to assess the implementation level of the projects in accordance with the eight poles of China-Africa cooperation and the recommendations to the members of the inter-ministerial committee.Among projects meant for Central African Republic, there are the rehabilitation of the Bimbo transmitting antenna of Radio Centrafrique, and the rehabilitation of Boali three hydro-electric dam. The meeting was chaired by the minister of planning, economy, and international cooperation, Sylvain Maliko. Then, the Chinese ambassador, Sui Hoo, reassured the government on these projects. Let us listen to him.[Begin Hoo recording] For the project of construction of the Boali hydro-electric dam, a Chinese technical team was on the ground, we drafted a plan, we submitted a quotation estimated at US$117 million. Our global fund is about US$7 billion. If the construction of the hydro-electric dam costs about US$117 million, based on the global fund of US$7 billion, I have to tell you the truth, the means of the Chinese Government are limited. And with the current economic growth of China, I am sure that the Chinese Government's assistance will significantly increase in favour of African sisters and brothers. I am sure that by next year, even by the end of this year, we will see, China will deploy agricultural experts, or volunteers, to help you develop agriculture or other sectors.

"724","China","Joint venture to finish hydroelectric dam (Duplicate)","2006","true","Jul 25, 2006 (Addis Fortune/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Foreign Affairs Minister, Seyoum Mesfin, appears to be having an exhilarating moment with Girma Birru, minister of Trade and Industry, and Fikru Desalegn, state minister of Capacity Building and board chairman of EEPCo. The signing of the 15 billion Br contract with Salini on Wednesday, July 19, is believed to be a milestone in the 55-year history of the state-owned utility monopoly. The high profile nature of Gilgel Gibe III hydroelectric power project is not only evident from how much it will have cost when construction is completed in five years. The unusual turnout of four senior ministers of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's administration at the singing ceremony for the 15 billion Br contract on Wednesday, July 19, speaks volume on what the project means to this government. When Meheret Debebe, general manager of the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo), signed this deal in the Lalibela Ball Room of the Sheraton Addis with Claudio Lautizi, Salini's general manager for International Division, Seyoum Mesfin, minister of Foreign Affairs, appeared for the first time ever at such an event. Normally, public works contract signings crave to even have a state minister in the audience. Also in attendance Wednesday were Girma Birru, minister of Trade and Industry, Alemayehu Tegenu, minister of Mines and Energy, and Hassen Abdella, minister of Labour and Social Affairs, joined by 150 other guests of high standing from both the public and private sector. This project is dear to Prime Minister Meles, said a senior minister. He follows its developments closely for he believes that without taking advantage of its own natural power generation capacity, Ethiopia is heading nowhere, said the official. 'In the global picture where oil is getting scarce and ever more expensive, hydropower is the white oil of Ethiopia: clear and renewable,' said Mr. Lautizi, confirming the Prime Minister's passion for mega constructions geared for power generation. Indeed, it is under the administration of this Prime Minister that Ethiopia has experienced a record high power generation capacity. When he took power 14 years ago, the country was generating only 455mw, compared to the 750mw it generates today. Still, this capacity only covers 17pc of the country's area. A few major hydro electric projects were completed in the past decade: Tis Abay II (80mw) and Finchaa IV (34mw). The largest to date, however, is Gilgel Gibe I, built by Salini and the Spanish NESCO near the town of Jimma, in Oromia Regional State, at a cost 2.2 billion Br. It generates 184mw in electrical power. It is to be supplemented with the follow-up project (Gilgel Gibe II) that added tunnels to generate 425mw. At a projected cost of 400 million Br, Gilgel Gibe II is currently under construction by Salini Costrottori SPA. Salini is also building another hydroelectric power project on the Belesa River, Amhara Regional State, at a cost of 5.4 billion Br, believed to have a projected generation capacity of 460mw upon completion. Up in the north, a Chinese and Ethiopian (Sur) joint venture is undertaking a 1.9 billion Br project to finish a hydroelectric dam on the Tekeze River, which will be generating 300mw when it is completed in 2008. 'EEPCo never had four live projects going at the same time in its 51 years history,' said an official. As part of its 25-year power sector expansion master plan, developed two years ago, EEPCo has designed a five-year strategic plan to expand the electric coverage to 50pc by 2010, generating over 4,000mw electric power. The five-year plan will cost an estimated 53 billion Br. The successful completion of Gilgel Gibe III alone is believed to help it accomplish 40pc of this target. The wonder of Gilgel Gibe III, strangely named for it will not be built on the river of Gilgel Gibe, is not only the size of its investment or its projected generation capacity of 1,870mw: it is rather how it came into being. 'It is concluded passing through the most efficient feasibility study and design completion,' Meheret told a stunned audience. The Italians clearly used insight and understanding of Ethiopia's resources, accumulated during their brief colonial time, in preparing for the Gilgel Gibe III project. What would have taken a minimum of 15 years to identify and develop has taken the consulting firm, Coyne Et Bellier (ELC), a mere 18 months. Meheret himself did little to contain his incredulity at how the engineering, procurement and construction contract process was completed in such a short time. 'This project is a fast-track record even for us,' said Mr. Lautizi. The financing is the most attractive part for the government, according to officials. Not only did Salini approach it with the project proposal and conduct all the studies by itself, it also came with a scheme to find 65pc of the project value, to be borrowed from the European Investment Bank. The country's balance of payment and foreign cash reserves are not touched. The remaining balance is to be covered by EEPCo's own local sources, through borrowing. The construction of this project on the Omo River, in the Southern National, Nationalities and Peoples State, will include a 270m high dam that will hold 14.7 million cubic meters water. It will be the first dam in the country to contain 10 turbine units, accessed by five kilometres of tunnels. Each unit is projected to generate 187mw of electric power, the equivalent of what Gilgel Gibe I generates today. The project also involves the extension of 550Km of transmission lines from the generation plant to Wolayta, and from Wolayta to Kaliti and Mega substations. The lines will cost the Corporation an additional two billion Birr, according to EEPCo officials. Meheret believes that the construction years ahead will bring additional business opportunity to both private and public companies in oil, transport, cement, hotels, tourism, insurance, banking, manufacturing, engineering and transit, an estimated six billion Birr. However big the investment, Mr. Lautizi believes EEPCo will return its investment in only five years of operation. 'In this way, it will not only open the way to the growth of Ethiopia in the coming years, but will also help the regional development of East Africa and contribute to its peaceful stability, a very important factor,' he told those who came to witness the signing ceremony at the Sheraton. 'In return, Ethiopia will earn income that may be used for importing what is needed from aboard.' Indeed, the gap in Ethiopia's current account balance soured significantly in 2005 by a negative 1013pc (from -233pc in 2001), according to the World Bank, with its spending to buy goods and services increasing to 4.3 billion dollars, up from 1.9 billion Br, in the same period.

"1327","China","Selling Cheap Goods to Mauritania","2005","true","Hundreds of newly-arrived Chinese wholesale merchants are flooding Senegal's capital Dakar, with cheap goods, pleasing customers and retailers, but angering their Senegalese competitors. At the Centenaire market in Dakar, Chinese wholesalers line the street on both sides, renting warehouses for $1,000 a month, selling everything in bulk from plastic toys to space-age looking DVD players. One buyer, Fatou Gueye, says Senegalese are poor and they love these new shops, because, she says finally she can afford something. Here she says, she can buy for children and adults, for her whole family, almost everything they need. One man who has just turned himself from chronically unemployed to retailer is also very pleased. He is buying bras, cameras, shoes, belt buckles, pots, pans, colorful pens and notebooks to resell in stores and on the streets of Dakar. He says it was very cheap to start his business. He started by selling a Chinese pair of shoes he had bought here for $1. There was no way of finding shoes for under $5 besides flip-flops before. For many people who live on several dollars a day, that's a big difference. The Senegalese manager of one of the warehouses says the Chinese have created jobs. He says young kids who used to be pickpockets are now hired as messengers. Asked whether Senegalese are not afraid the quality of Chinese goods might not be so good, he says that's nonsense. Senegalese want quantity, he says, they want to be able to afford things. Generally, prices in the Chinese shops are three to five times cheaper than in Lebanese or Senegalese stores. The invasion started last year when Senegal's government signed a bilateral agreement with China, to encourage Chinese businessmen to set up shop in Dakar. So-called Senegalese investment packages which include visas have been made readily available in China. But Senegalese shopkeepers say many Chinese who bribe their way buy these business visas at lower than official prices, for about $1,000 a year, and that Chinese typically undervalue their incoming goods to pay lower customs fees as well. One shopkeeper told VOA he is furious. 'Now I think that I have to change business or to change work because business is very hard because of the Chinese here in Senegal,' he said. 'We have to stop them here because they do not pay customs, they have bad, bad, bad products. Chinese are going to destroy our country. They have to go out. Chinese, they are going to kill our economy. Chinese merchants refused to be interviewed for this report, saying their command of French and English was not good enough for an interview, only for making deals. A social commentator, Aboubacar Oumar, tells VOA, Senegal might currently be the world's most open country to Chinese merchants. 'Senegal has what they call an open door market policy which means that government don't interfere in private sector business initiatives,' he said. 'So whoever can come in and invest. What they do is they open the market for competition. So if the Chinese are selling at a cheaper price, what will happen, is if the Senegalese businessmen the way they are complaining, maybe the government will step in to regulate the market and probably put quotas on the Chinese,' added Mr. Oumar. For now, the government has yet to interfere. Chinese wholesalers say they can make several thousand dollars a day being based in Dakar, compared to Senegalese merchants who say they usually struggle to make $100 in a month. The invasion is having an impact in the region as well, as trucks can be heard coming in and out of the Centenaire market, taking the cheap Chinese goods to Mauritania, Mali, the Gambia and even the continent's biggest market, Nigeria.

"1540","China","Not a project: $500m Investment in Oil Blocs","2004","true","See ID# 1536, 1707, 193'China's state oil firm Sinopec, plans to invest about $500 million on the development of two shallow water oil blocs which lie in Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 64 and 66.Sinopec is the operator of the two blocs owned by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NDPC).The Federal Government had early this year approved a service contract agreement entered into by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corpo-ration (NNPC) with Sino-pec, which provided for the Chinese oil firm as the lead contractor for a period of three years.At the end of the three year period, NPDC engineers are to take over the operatorship of the blocs, which lie in shallow waters of less than 100 metres in offshore Rivers State.Emerging details of the recent visit by the Chinese economic and trade delegation to Nigeria during which they met with the Special Adviser to the president on Petroleum and Energy, Dr. Edmund Daukoru, revealed that the intending investors sought preferential consideration in the next round of bidding for the deepwater off shore scheduled for 2005.NPDC, the oil producing arm of the NNPC, currently produces at 30,000 barrels per day with reserves level of 300 million barrels.Nigeria, which sees the emergence of the Chinese investors in the country's oil and gas sector as a break in western monopoly, is keen on getting the Chinese involved in the privatisation of the refineries, the pipelines together with the storage depots and the distribution systems, as well as financing of the marginal fields.Thirty-one local oil firms granted licences to operate 24 marginal fields, are currently in search of funds to develop the fields.Chinese businessmen have only recently made known plans to set up projects worth about $7 billion in Nigeria.The investment will be in the area of power generation, crude oil exploration and production, coal processing, setting up of an export refinery and a petrochemical plant and in agriculture.The Federal Government has set up a 15-member steering committee to work out modalities for seeing all the proposed projects through.The committee is headed by Special Adviser to the President on Manufactur-ing and Private Sector, Alhaji Ahmed Abdulkadir, has its members drawn from both the public and private sectors, including Daukoru and four other ministers.The Chinese investors would specifically be pumping $1.5 billion into the development of a Nigerian continental shelf oil bloc, OPL 229.The bloc is owned jointly by two indigenous oil firms, Emerald Energy Resources Limited and Amni International Petroleum.The plan also includes the setting up of an export refinery with a processing capacity of about 180,000 barrels per day (bpd), and the construction of a petrochemical plant by a company known as SinoLink Hydrocarbon Techno-logies. ' 'Paris (Platts)-25Oct2004/837 am EDT/1237 GMT The Nigerian government has set up a technical committee to monitor China's proposal to take over the government's equity in the Port Harcourt and Kaduna oil refineries as well as developing oil blocks 65 and 111, state-owned NNPC's spokesman said Monday. 'There is delegation from China in Abuja as we speak and they are working with us to see what we can achieve. They are definitely interested in the refineries,' he said. The technical committee will also study the possibility of Chinese firms investing in Eleme Petrochemical Company as well as participating in oil exploration in the Chad Basin. The Chinese government has said it plans to invest $500-mil in Nigeria's upstream sector and a further $30-mil for development of the downstream industry. The China Export and Credit Insurance Corp has also pledged $7-bil investment in power generation, coal and agriculture in the next few years.Paris (Platts)-25Oct2004/838 am EDT/1238 GMT Nigeria's presidential adviser on petroleum Edmund Daukoru said the Chinese investments should not be misconstrued to mean that the government is handing over strategic assets China. 'The Chinese are not taking over all the refining opportunities, nothing of that sort is being implied by this business relationship. There is still a level playing field and the more competition we can get the better,' he said, quoted in the ThisDay newspaper. The Bureau of Public Enterprise, the agency managing the government's privatization program, is offering 51% stakes in each of the badly deteriorated Warri, Kaduna and the two Port Harcourt refineries to core investors, while the government, through NNPC, is expected to retain a minority stake. Attracting interest in the four plants, which have suffered years of under-investment, is proving a difficult task. The country's major operators failed to show interest when the bids were called in last November given the enormous investment required to repair the ailing plants, which began operations between 1965 and 1988.Paris (Platts)-25Oct2004/839 am EDT/1239 GMT Bowing to pressure from the country's powerful oil unions, the government last December agreed to invest $150-mil in revamping key production units that would restore production at the plants to full optimal levels before privatization. Daukoru recently told Platts that Shell, which pumps around 1-mil b/d of Nigeria's total production, had expressed interest in taking on a management consultancy role as opposed to direct ownership. Despite having a total domestic refining capacity of 445,000 b/d, Nigeria, Africa's biggest crude producer, is forced to import about 70% of its own fuel requirements. China, in a desperate search for hydrocarbons to sustain its rapid economic development, is building up a network of energy-related relationships throughout west and north Africa particularly Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, Chad, Niger and Gabon. It recently clinched a 50% stake in Angola's deepwater block 18, beating off competition from India's ONGC Videsh by reportedly offering about $2-bil in aid for a raft of projects. ' 'The Nigerian government has set up a technical committee to monitor China's proposal to take over the government's equity in the Port Harcourt and Kaduna oil refineries as well as developing oil blocks 65 and 111, a state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp spokesman said Oct 25.'There is a delegation from China in Abuja as we speak and they are working with us to see what we can achieve.

The unions accused NNPC of sabotaging the refineries despite the $700-mil spent on repairs in the last four years to benefit from lucrative fuel import contracts. Seven senior NNPC managers were sacked in April 2003 following an investigation into high port fees paid on imported oil products and the alleged falsification of bills of lading which cost Nigeria some $108-mil last year.Although private oil marketers are now allowed under a deregulation policy introduced last October to import and set prices of gasoline and diesel, the NNPC still plays a major role in fuel imports and distribution.The NNPC spokesman Oct 25 denied reports retail fuel prices had increased to Naira 75/liter ($0.57/liter) and said it would shut marketers caught selling above the Naira 55/liter government ceiling. 'Those are rumors to incite labor to go on strike. Prices are still around Naira 53-54/liter,' an NNPC spokesman said.The Nigeria Labour Congress suspended a four-day warning strike Oct 14 and gave President Olusegun Obasanjo's government two weeks to meet strikers' demands and stabilize prices. Retail prices Sep 23 jumped 20%, the latest in a series of hikes since Obasanjo deregulated sales and removed subsidies.The NNPC spokesman said a new pricing committee set up by the government held regular meetings with NLC and agreed to discuss a mechanism for achieving stability in prices. 'Local prices are not likely to go up any further,' he said.The NLC, the most powerful political opposition to Obasanjo, is holding a meeting of its National Executive Council Oct 26 to decide whether to relaunch its strike. ' 'Chinese firm explores oil in Chad Basin By Chesa Chesa, state house correspondent, Abuja More crude oil will soon flow from Nigerian soil as President Olusegun Obasanjo on Monday midwifed an agreement between a Chinese firm - SINOPEC and the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) for the exploration of oil in the Chad Basin.The President, who witnessed the signing of the agreement between NNPC Group Managing Director, Funsho Kupolokun, and the Vice President of SINOPEC, at the presidential villa, also announced that SINOPEC would build a refinery in Nigeria and get fully involved in the upstream and downstream sectors of the petroleum industry.SINOPEC won the oil exploration contract for Blocs 64 and 66 in the Chad Basin, following government's decision to offer 27 oil blocs to investors in order to boost oil production quota from the current 2.6 million to 4 million barrels per day by 2010.Some oil wells being explored in the Chad Basin by Shell, Elf and Chevron were abandoned four years ago on the orders of government.Obasanjo, who assured the Chinese of government's protection of their investments, disclosed that China, which produces 40 percent of television sets in the world, has agreed to produce TV sets in Nigeria.He also announced that a Nigerian telecommunications satellite would be built and launched by a Chinese firm soon, and thanked the Chinese government for providing $2.25 million grant for economic and technological cooperation between the two countries.The president said the federal government has invited China Railway Ministry to come and help develop Nigerian railways.Earlier, the visiting chairman of the Chinese standing committee of the National Peoples Congress, Mr. Wu Bangguo, expressed his country's interest in exploring marginal oil fields in Nigeria.Bangguo, who is on an official trip to Nigeria, said China was equally interested in telecommunications and power generation, and commended the federal government for closing the Taiwan business office in Abuja, as a mark of Nigeria's policy of one China.Meanwhile, President Obasanjo on Monday received strong commendation from the ECOWAS parliament for his 'untiring efforts to bring peace to the sub-region and the entire continent'.Speaker of the parliament, Prof Ali Nouhoum Diallo, who led a delegation of the legislative body to Aso Rock, said the parliament shared and supported Obasanjo's views that Africa's problems were better handled by Africans.Diallo disclosed that the parliament had asked the international community to support Obasanjo's peace efforts and to help African countries recover stolen money stashed in European banks.The president had in his response, commended the ECOWAS parliament for the progress it has made so far towards regional integration.

"1970","China","Friendship Port continues with financing of new pier (likely duplicate, see ID# 3)","2008","true"," Focus China and EU to finance the upgrading of Mauritanian ports. Pieter Tesch 566 words 12 May 2008Lloyd's List LL 6 English (c) 2008 Informa PLC MAURITANIA’s ramshackle port infrastructure is about to be upgraded and updated with major projects at the capital Nouakchott and the northern port of Nouadhibou, Transport Minister Ahmed Ould Mohameden told Lloyd’s List.Mr Mohameden explained thatMauritania has signed an agreement with China for a $300m project to extend the “Friendship Port”, built by the Chinese between 1979 and 1984, with a new 450 m pier.When the desert country in northwest Africa became independent from the French in 1960 there was not even a town at Nouakchott, designated the capital, and for years after independence the French refused to build a port on the nearby Atlantic coast to service the new capital because of their port interests in neighbouring Senegal.But as usual, when western former colonial powers refuse to invest in infrastructural projects in Africa, the Chinese step in.They have now agreed to extend the port facilities because Nouakchott, now home to nearly one third of just under 3m Mauritanians, is thriving. The country is benefitting from investment in its fledgling offshore industry alongside investment in its two other pillars of export: iron ore and other minerals, as well as the fishing industry.Following a visit in April of Dubai World’s chairman Sultan bin Sulayem, Mr Mohameden is negotiating with United Arab Emirates and other Gulf interests on another project that could extend the new planned pier by another 450 m.“This project will include a new container terminal as well, with refrigerating facilities, and a designated free zone to attract further investment to the commercial port,” said Mr Mohameden.He added that, in conjunction with these projects, the government wants to transform the artisanal fishing port, where canoes still land on the beach, into amodern fishing port big enough not only for modern seagoing trawlers but also to handle reefer hips for the export of frozen fish.The government has plans for processing plants to be established around the port as part of a strategy to increase substantially its fish-processing capacity and to increase value-added fish exports.A similar plan is about to be implemented for the northern commercial and fishing port of Nouadhibou, formerly St Etienne, on Cape Blanc, with plans to extend and build new quays and piers for the commercial and fishing ports here, said Mr Mohameden.He explained that tenders would soon be invited for the quay extensions, financed with European Union development money, which will include the deepening of the draught to 8 m for the commercial port and 6 m for the fishing port, as well as land reclamation.Nouadhibou port has the advantage over Nouakchott of being a natural shelter, but neglect during the 1980s and 1990s means that numerous shipwrecks of former Soviet Union and Eastern Block trawlers and factory ships have made the port unsightly and dangerous in places.It was hoped that the EU would assist in funding to clear these wrecks and finance a feasibility study into the further development of the iron ore port, just south of Nouadhibou, said Mr Mohameden.“The Chinese will start their work before the end of the year and the whole project, including the 450 m new pier, should be finished within three years. It is hoped that other projects will start within that period,” he said.1086889125 ","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Unset","","Grant (excluding debt forgiveness)","Unset","","Mauritania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LL00000020080509e45c0000o&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"2142","China","Chinese troops pour into Sudan to fight rebels (TRUE?)","2000","true","28 August 2000National Post FINP National A12 English (c) National Post 2000. All Rights Reserved. LONDON - Tens of thousands of Chinese have been moved into Sudan in preparation for a major offensive against southern rebels to try to end one of Africa's longest-running conflicts, according to Western counter-terrorism officials. The Chinese, a mixture of prisoners and soldiers, have been brought in by aircraft and ship, ostensibly to guard Sudan's increasingly productive oilfields in which the China National Petroleum Corp. is a leading partner. Colonel Johnny Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) has managed in recent weeks to advance within 16 kilometres of the oilfields in the Upper Nile region, causing the country's Islamic regime to activate emergency plans drawn up with allies whose interests in the oil project are directly under threat. These plans aim to crush the rebels from the mainly Christian and animist south and bring to an end the 17-year civil war that has cost an estimated two million lives. Since oil production began last year, arms have been arriving from Libya, Qatar and China. The ruling National Islamic Front (NIF) is spending US$450-million a year of its oil revenues on weapons, according to Western intelligence sources. The NIF denies this charge but last month General Mohamed Osman Yassin, the Sudanese army spokesman, told student conscripts that 'thanks to our growing oil industry'' Sudan is now 'manufacturing ammunition, mortars, tanks and armoured personnel carriers.' The SPLA captured a group of Chinese in an attack last week. An internal document from the Sudanese military said that as many as 700,000 Chinese security personnel were available for action. Baroness Caroline Cox, a British human rights campaigner who has just returned from Sudan where she helped free 353 slaves captured by NIF soldiers, accused Western governments of turning a blind eye to what is going on because of their own economic interests in the oil. 'If with foreign help the NIF regime crushes all opposition, we will have entrenched in the heart of Africa a militant Islamist regime aimed at spreading terrorism throughout the continent,'' she warned. 'It's unbelievably serious for the future of democracy in Africa and could happen in the next few weeks.'' She criticized the British government, which last month welcomed the Sudanese Foreign Minister on a visit even though Sudan is still technically under United Nations sanctions that ban such visits, and is officially still regarded as a pariah state. 'The British government has developed a complete cosy relationship to a regime, which is raping, bombing and taking its people into slavery,'' she said. Two British companies have won contracts to build pumping stations on the 1,600-kilometre pipeline from the Heglig oilfield, in the war-torn south, to the Red Sea. Canadian multinational Talisman Energy has also faced public outcry over its involvement in the pipeline. Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's Foreign Minister, sent a mission to Sudan to assess the situation. A UN official told the mission: 'If oil companies don't know what's going on they're not looking over the fences of their compounds.'' On Saturday, the U.S. government condemned the raids on civilian and relief targets including schools, hospitals and feeding stations. According to the SPLA, five such attacks took place last week. A Western aid worker from one of the few organizations operating in southern Sudan said: 'Eeryone knows what is going on. We'e all seen the Chinese being brought in and can only pray about what's going to happen next.''

"2374","China","$3b energy investment (not in Somalia)","2006","true","'Text of report by Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak website on 28 December[Column by Ibrahim Karagul: 'Abizaid Sparks Dirty War With One Visit!']A third front has been opened in addition to Central Asia and the Middle East. After Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine this fifth conflict has been sparked off in Somalia in East Africa, known as the Horn of Africa, a land at least as important as Yemen or the Gulf of Basra or the Eastern Mediterranean. Immediately after 9/11 the United States turned Djibouti into a military base and put the Red Sea under blockade. It is now occupying another country again citing Islamists, terrorism and Al-Qa'idah. But this time it is not doing this directly but with the soldiers of Somalia's neighbour Ethiopia. Ethiopian soldiers, trained, armed and financed by the United States, have been occupying Somalia for several days now and bombing it from the air while the US Navy has laid a sea blockade. How much does Somalia concern us? As much as Afghanistan? As much as Iraq? As much as Lebanon? Believe me it concerns us as much as all of them. The war in Somalia is so very connected to the Lebanon and Iraq crises.Somalia is a poor country devastated by civil war. But that does not concern anybody. Again it is energy, again energy! After the civil war in 1993 and the US intervention fighting again broke out this summer. The Islamist groups were able to take control of a large part of the country despite the war lords and their terrorist organizations. During the fighting in June the United States openly gave financing and weapons to the terrorist groups fighting the Islamist groups, and took part in the fighting through clandestine operations. But, it failed. The Islamists took Mogadishu.I wrote back then, 'Somalia is being turned into a new target for the United States.' Now it is coming true. The Ethiopian army has been attacking Somalia for a few days now. It is occupying Somalia lands and bombing everywhere. The United States, which earlier supported the anti-Islamist groups, is now occupying Somalia using the 15,000-strong Ethiopian army, which it has trained, financed and armed. So, what is the reason for this war? I wrote it once before. Let me repeat:The United States conducted a bloody operation into Somalia using thousands of soldiers in 1993. But there was a terrible disaster. It was a complete fiasco. There was even a movie made about the operation, 'Black Hawk Down.' The aim, as always, was humanitarian intervention! Yet five US companies had all but closed off two thirds of Somalia in order to carry out soundings for oil and gas. This operation was conducted in order to provide security for these companies' interests. The plan failed and these companies' interests were still in jeopardy.In recent years Sudan has emerged as a very important oil country. China, which is opening up across all of Africa and which is forming a balance to offset the United States, made $3 billion of energy investments in Sudan. Sudan was going to meet a significant amount of Beijing's energy needs. Furthermore, it was going to lay an oil pipeline from the south to the Red Sea. China and other Asian oil companies took control of energy investments in many African countries. Furthermore, they started to rebuild the countries they were cooperating with in order to save them from the West's technological and economic pressure. The United States responded to Asia's ventures into Sudan with oil-and gas-rich Darfur. Bringing the UN to its side the United States began a humanitarian intervention project in Darfur because Darfur was emerging as another energy resource. China announced it would veto the UN's resolutions on Darfur and Sudan. They were using Darfur to make Sudan pay the price of collaboration with China. Now, they are making Somalia pay.Just like Yemen, Somalia is a critical country for energy security. If it falls into the hands of others the United States' corridor between Africa and the Middle East will collapse. The United States and its allies, who have been laying siege to the Horn of Africa militarily since 9/11, have all but occupied the Red Sea in the name of fighting Al-Qa'idah and terrorism. Whatever the United States' reason is for invading Afghanistan, whatever its reason is for taking Yemen under control; that is the same reason it has for controlling Somalia.Somalia is not an oil-rich country. Its known reserves are some 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas. But it is known that the country harbours very rich oil and natural gas resources, and that it provides a new opportunity for the United States both by virtue of its own resources and the fact that it straddles the transit route for Middle East oil. US oil companies such as Conoco, Amoco, Chevron and Philips wanted the country to be made secure and for soundings to begin immediately. As a result of this the United States began to offer financial and military support to the warlords in the country. The 'International Crisis Group' established by George Soros took its place on the stage.The operation in 1993 was restarted in a different shape. The way ahead for these companies was going to open up. Civil war again erupted as the result of clandestine operations. This was a new front in the great energy war and the geopolitical game. But the calculations did not stick. The anti-US forces won. They took the capital after four months of fighting. This was the United States' second defeat in Somalia. But less than six months later the United States went in again but this time via Ethiopia. It placed a naval blockade on Somalia. They had been gearing up for this fight since 2001 in order to open the way for the oil companies. Now they have begun. This conflict could spread to East Africa. The whole region could go up in flames all for the sake of controlling the Red Sea.Another note to the cautious: General John Abizaid, who is in charge of the US armies in Iraq, was in Ethiopia this month. A few days later the Ethiopian army acting with the United States switched to the attack. Interesting, is it not? Immediately after China's Head of State Hu Jintao went to Kenya, Sudan and Ethiopia and made energy agreements. We have a new Afghanistan, a new Iraq, anew Lebanon. Somalia, the fifth Muslim country to be drenched in blood as the giants fight, might be along way from you but it is very close to the United States and China.Source: Yeni Safak website, Istanbul, in Turkish 28 Dec 06a5999adbDocument BBCEUP0020061229e2ct000b5'","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Unset","","Somalia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCEUP0020061229e2ct000b5&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The existing international legal instruments concerning outer space are not sufficient to effectively prevent the spread of weapons to outer space. The international community should negotiate and conclude a new international legal instrument to close the loopholes in the existing legal system concerning outer space.In February 2008 China and Russia jointly submitted to the CD a draft Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects. China hopes that the CD will start substantial discussions on the draft as soon as possible, and negotiate and conclude the Treaty at an early date.Conventional Arms ControlChina has earnestly fulfilled its obligations under the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) and its Protocols. It has taken concrete measures to ensure that its anti-personnel landmines in service meet the relevant technical requirements of the Amended Protocol on Landmines. China actively participates in the work of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Cluster Munitions. China is also continuing its preparations for ratifying the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War. China has continuously taken an active part in international humanitarian de-mining assistance. In the past two years, it has held de-mining training courses for Angola, Mozambique, Chad, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, and both northern and southern Sudan. China has also donated de-mining equipment to the above-mentioned countries and Egypt, and provided Peru, Ecuador and Ethiopia with mine eradication funds.China has actively participated in the international efforts to combat the illicit trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW). It has conscientiously implemented the UN Program of Action (PoA) on SALW and the International Instrument on Identifying and Tracing Illicit SALW. China has issued and implemented new detailed rules on SALW markings, and has taken part in the work of the UN GGE on an 'Arms Trade Treaty'.Transparency in Military Expenditures and Registration of Transfer of Conventional ArmsChina attaches great importance to military transparency, and makes unremitting efforts to enhance military transparency and promote mutual trust with other countries in the military sphere. In 2007 China joined the UN Standardized Instrument for Reporting Military Expenditures, and reports annually to the UN the basic data of its military expenditures for the latest fiscal year.China has made important contributions to the establishment and development of the UN Register of Conventional Arms. After the Register was established, China provided the Register with annual data on imports and exports of conventional arms in the seven categories covered by the Register. However, since 1996 a particular country has provided data on its arms sales to Taiwan to the Register, which contradicts the spirit of the relevant Resolutions of the UN General Assembly as well as the objectives and principles of the Register. China was impelled to suspend its submission of data to the Register. Since the country concerned has stopped the above-mentioned act, China has resumed, since 2007, submitting data annually to the Register on imports and exports of conventional arms in the seven categories.

"1281","China","China's Aid to Slow Desert Spread (Not a project)","2006","true","INTERVIEW-Women's help vital in slowing spread of deserts By Ben Blanchard 507 words 31 May 2006 07:42 AMReuters News LBA English (c) 2006 Reuters Limited BEIJING, May 31 (Reuters) - Women, who make up about 70 percent of rural workers worldwide, are key to turning back the spread of deserts, the head of the United Nations' main agency on rural poverty said on Wednesday. Desertification and land degradation threatens the livelihoods of over one billion people in more than 100 countries and causes annual economic losses of $6.5 billion, according to the U.N. And it is women who must be bought into the fight against the spreading sands, Lennart Bage, president of the Rome-based International Fund for Agricultural Development, told Reuters in an interview. 'Women are very often at the frontline of fighting desertification, or managing land degradation, because very often, in many parts of the world, women are the farmers,' he said, sitting in the U.N.'s Beijing offices. 'Women are crucial, as very often they are the ones responsible for the family for getting fuel wood, water and for tending the fields,' Bage added. 'They often know a lot about resource management.' With spreading deserts making it harder to eke out a living on the land, many men are leaving for urban areas, leaving their families behind and women to confront worsening soil and climatic conditions. 'You have migration taking place, and in many societies the men migrate. So they leave the household and they send back money, but to keep the fields growing and livestock tended to, it's very often left to women and children,' Bage said. About 70 percent of the fund's projects are located in marginal areas, often being affected by desertification. Oer the last 23 years, they have pumped in $3.5 billion to help dry and desertified regions from China to Mauritania. Yet in many African countries, women are denied land ownership and do not even have the right to plant trees or build sand control measures. They also often farm the worst, most marginal land. And it is hard for them to get collateral for bank loans to improve their land. 'We have a policy and a goal to include a gender dimension in all the projects we're involved in. It is key,' said Bage, a Swedish national with more than 25 years in international development. And aid must be directed in a culturally appropriate way, taking into account local conditions, especially the role women play in society, he said. 'The disregard for local knowledge and local commitment ... is one of the main reasons for the failure of so much well intentioned aid.' But desertification is still a problem that has not been beaten. 'In some areas we're winning, but in some areas we're losing,' he said. 'You can't be complacent about it. It's certainly a losing battle in some of the poorest parts of the world.'

All rights reserved.China and Angola, despite the long distance between the two countries, have been enjoying good relations especially in the field of economy and trade.The economic cooperation between the Asian and African nations could date back to 1983 when the bilateral diplomatic relationship was established.However, due to the 27-year civil war in Angola, the economic ties have not been fully developed although there were some Chinese companies doing business in Angola before the end of the war in April last year.Since early 1990s, the trade between the two countries began to develop gradually. In 2000, the trade volume reached US$1.876 billion compared with US$150 million in 1995.According to some estimation, the trade volume could stand at US$2 billion this year as the first nine months have seen it reaching US$1.7 billion.In order to accelerate the reconstruction of country after the civil war, the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has put forward an 'economic diplomacy' policy to attract foreign investment and technology and further develop trade with other countries.Two projects funded by the Chinese government on rebuilding the telecommunication network in three Angolan provinces and repairing some parts of Angolan railways have been carried out in October and November this year respectively.Besides, the Chinese government also provided Angola with economic aid in terms of grants and interest-free loans to the African country to help the displaced.The 15,000-sq. meter economic houses in Luanda, capital of Angola, built by a Chinese company with US$11 million of interest-free loan from the Chinese government have been deeply welcomed by the Angolan people.After seeing what the Chinese government companies have done in Angola, President dos Santos more than once expressed his hope that more Chinese businessmen would come to Angola to invest, trade and participate in the reconstruction of the country.Angola, a country with rich natural resources such as oil and diamond, needs assistance from other countries including China for rebuilding, dos Santos said.As the trade between China and Angola is complementary, the bilateral economic cooperation will surely come to a new high in the process of reconstructing Angola.Document BDU0000020031124dzbo0000p","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Unset","","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Angola","

"925","China","","2000","true"," GENEVA, December 12 (Xinhua) - China supports the international treaty that bans and restricts the use of inhumane conventional weapons and is encouraging more countries to accept it, a senior Chinese disarmament official said on Monday.At the Second Annual Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Amended Protocol II, the head of the Chinese delegation, Sha Zukang, brought up the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.'The Chinese delegation has noted that, since the last annual conference, the number of countries that have acceded to the amended protocol has increased from 45 to 58,' said Sha. 'This shows that more and more countries attach importance to the Protocol, which is the first international legal instrument to address this issue of humanitarian concern. Now, almost all major land mine producing and using countries have acceded to the protocol.'However, Sha said, 58 states are too few. 'Lack of universality will undercut the protocol's significance,' he stressed. 'And no matter how perfect an international legal instrument is, its influence and effectiveness will be limited in the absence of universal participation.'He urged the states to follow the Protocol in earnest.Sha announced that the Chinese delegation is strongly opposed to any proposal for further amending the protocol at the current stage.However, he said, states may, on a voluntary basis, take the lead in implementing technical specifications as outlined in the proposed amendments and provide gratuitous technical assistance, equipment and training to developing countries.On humanitarian de-mining, Sha said that the Chinese government is continuing to cooperate with the Mine Action Service of the United Nations Department of Peace-Keeping Operations by co-sponsoring another training workshop on de-mining technology from May to June this year, with trainees from Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Rwanda.The Chinese government is pressing rapidly ahead with its donations of de-mining equipment to Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Namibia, he added.'We hope this conference will strengthen exchanges and cooperation on de-mining technologies for reducing and ultimately doing away with land mines Sha said.He emphasized that the Chinese government stands ready to cooperate and exchange with interested countries and inter-organizations in the field of humanitarian de-mining assistance and that China is also willing to join other states and explore ways to streamline the de-mining process.Document xnews00020010818dwcc01d3t","Unset","","","Unset","","Unset","Unset","","Unset","","0","","","","","","","Raw","0","Unset","1","Unset","","Inactive","2","","","","","","","","","","","1","Unset","","","","","","","","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

The acquisition of the rail took place through the state-owned parastatal National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) with assistance from the private firm North Limpopo Projects Investments, alongside financing aid from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The 11,000 pieces of rail, of a grand total of 15,000, were delivered to Rutgena Railway Station after shipment from China through Mozambique. The rail replacement was due to begin on Monday, October 23, 2006 with the tracks running from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls and Harare to Bulawayo getting top priority for replacement. However, a Zimbabwean media report from May 2011 indicated that track was still being welded and laid across Zimbabwe in North, Southeast, Dabuka-Harare, and Mutare Provinces. The Zimbabwean government was represented by the Minister of Transport and Communications, Christopher Mushowe; NRZ spokesperson Fanuel Masikati, and the president of the National Railways of Zimbabwe, Mike Karakadzai. It is noted that the flow of money for this project is in reverse, with Zimbabwean money, US$3 million provided by the Reserve Bank of ZImbabwe, and US$7.4 million provided by the National Railways of Zimbabwe and North Limpopo, being spent directly on Chinese goods.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","210","Implementation","2","Unset","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020061027e2ar001me&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Freddy Blay also in attendance, most political observers believed that it showed the magnanimity and the potential of the Minister on what he could do in the interest of the nation at a point in time.Dr. Addo-Kufuor in his opening address, recounted how he first visited China in October 2003 and had interactions with H.E. Chi Hao Cian, his contemporary Minister of Defence, which germinated style='BACKGROUND-COLOR:#FFFF00'>the four-storey building for the MoD.He disclosed that the project would cost US$6.75m of which the Chinese government is providing US$5m grant whilst this country provides US$1.75m, adding that the project would be completed within 18 months.Dr. Addo-Kufuor, who noted that the current MoD building in Burma Camp is an old single storey building, which does not befit the international standing and image of the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF), said, 'I therefore, consider the sod-cutting for this project as very timely and appropriate.' He said the new building would provide an appropriate, conducive and befitting working environment for the MoD and the top hierarchy of the GAF.He said that an important hallmark in the recent history of MoD has been the construction of significant structures on the military landscape, which he underscored include the Kofi Annan Centre, the second Phase of 37 Military Hospital, Beijing Barracks, Burma Camp Computer Centre and Commercial Complex, Burma Hall and others.To him, his Ministry will continue to do its best within the budgetary constraints to provide the needed physical infrastructure, logistic support and other needs of the GAF to enable service personnel perform the roles of defending the nation, the constitution and national institutions.He commended the Chinese government for demonstrating their commitment to helping this nation. He also commended Beijing Institute of Architectural designs for their beautiful design as well as the contractors of the project, Quingdao Construction cooperation Group of China.The Minister noted that the organizations have proven track records and that 'we have no doubt that the project will be executed to specification within the allotted time.'Dr. Kwame Addo Kufuor was of the opinion that this sod-cutting ceremony marks another positive step in the relations between the MoD and China.He also mentioned the assistance that his led Ministry has got from the China government which included Beijing barracks, the Donfeng Chinese trucks which he explained are currently in use in the GAF, and the K-8 Jet fighters from the CATIC Company.On his part, Mr. Wei Jianguo, Chinese Deputy Minister for Defence, hinted at his government's preparedness to cement the friendship between Ghana and China.In attendance were the La Mantse, Nii Tetteh Kpobi Tsuru and the Mayor of Accra, Nii Agyiri Blankson, Hon.

All rights reserved.China and Angola, despite the long distance between the two countries, have been enjoying good relations especially in the field of economy and trade.The economic cooperation between the Asian and African nations could date back to 1983 when the bilateral diplomatic relationship was established.However, due to the 27-year civil war in Angola, the economic ties have not been fully developed although there were some Chinese companies doing business in Angola before the end of the war in April last year.Since early 1990s, the trade between the two countries began to develop gradually. In 2000, the trade volume reached US$1.876 billion compared with US$150 million in 1995.According to some estimation, the trade volume could stand at US$2 billion this year as the first nine months have seen it reaching US$1.7 billion.In order to accelerate the reconstruction of country after the civil war, the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has put forward an 'economic diplomacy' policy to attract foreign investment and technology and further develop trade with other countries.Two projects funded by the Chinese government on rebuilding the telecommunication network in three Angolan provinces and repairing some parts of Angolan railways have been carried out in October and November this year respectively.Besides, the Chinese government also provided Angola with economic aid in terms of grants and interest-free loans to the African country to help the displaced.The 15,000-sq. meter economic houses in Luanda, capital of Angola, built by a Chinese company with US$11 million of interest-free loan from the Chinese government have been deeply welcomed by the Angolan people.After seeing what the Chinese government companies have done in Angola, President dos Santos more than once expressed his hope that more Chinese businessmen would come to Angola to invest, trade and participate in the reconstruction of the country.Angola, a country with rich natural resources such as oil and diamond, needs assistance from other countries including China for rebuilding, dos Santos said.As the trade between China and Angola is complementary, the bilateral economic cooperation will surely come to a new high in the process of reconstructing Angola.Document BDU0000020031124dzbo0000p ","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Unset","","Angola","

No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.Excerpt from report by Radio France Internationale on 4 July[Presenter] You will construct an airport for me in exchange for iron ore. This is not a joke but rather the illustration of a daring exchange between Mauritania and China.Mauritania has entrusted the construction of a new international airport at Nouakchott to China; which will disburse 136m dollars as a loan to Mauritania which the latter will repay in raw materials over several years.Marie-Pierre Lafont [phonetic] you are in Nouakchott. This economic exchange is rather favourable to Mauritania.[Lafont] Iron, just like fishing is one of Mauritania's main resources. For over two years now, China has been experiencing a serious shortage of the commodity. Peking's very high demand has already allowed the SNIM [National Industrial and Mining Company ] to maintain its production in recent months and reopen some deposits whose quality could satisfy the Chinese. This new large-scale exchange should avail greater support to a sector that has been experiencing difficult years. Precisely, each instalment to be paid will be reimbursed against its exchange value in iron tonnage. The operation should span over 16 years. Several hundred Chinese workers will work on the construction site which will be located some 20km north of the capital. The present airport is situated in the city centre. It cannot be expanded as there is no space to do so. As Mauritania prepares for its petroleum future, it expects an increase in air traffic in the coming years.Source: Radio France Internationale, Paris, in French 1230 gmt 4 Jul 05Document BBCAP00020050704e1740025t","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Tied","4","Mauritania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020050704e1740025t&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Tony Elumelu, UBA's chief executive, told the Financial Times: 'It provides us [with] an almost infinite amount of capital to execute projects.' He added: 'They will invest in any credit that we recommend.'By the CDB agreement, a copy of which has been seen by the Financial Times, Chinese staff from the bank will work with their counterparts at UBA's headquarters in Lagos to fund projects in West Africa.Mr Elumelu said he hoped by the end of March to strike an agreement with CDB to finance a power project that would help to tackle Nigeria's chronic electricity shortages.UBA, with a balance sheet of about $8bn, hopes to expand into as many as 12 African countries next year.'It is no longer a question of funding capability, but about our ability to identify good projects,' Mr Elumelu said. 'Africa is a huge untapped market - but it takes those who understand African markets and African risks to take advantage.'CDB has more assets than the World Bank and Asian Development Bank combined, with $281bn of loans outstanding by the end of June.

All rights reserved.China and Angola, despite the long distance between the two countries, have been enjoying good relations especially in the field of economy and trade.The economic cooperation between the Asian and African nations could date back to 1983 when the bilateral diplomatic relationship was established.However, due to the 27-year civil war in Angola, the economic ties have not been fully developed although there were some Chinese companies doing business in Angola before the end of the war in April last year.Since early 1990s, the trade between the two countries began to develop gradually. In 2000, the trade volume reached US$1.876 billion compared with US$150 million in 1995.According to some estimation, the trade volume could stand at US$2 billion this year as the first nine months have seen it reaching US$1.7 billion.In order to accelerate the reconstruction of country after the civil war, the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has put forward an 'economic diplomacy' policy to attract foreign investment and technology and further develop trade with other countries.Two projects funded by the Chinese government on rebuilding the telecommunication network in three Angolan provinces and repairing some parts of Angolan railways have been carried out in October and November this year respectively.Besides, the Chinese government also provided Angola with economic aid in terms of grants and interest-free loans to the African country to help the displaced.The 15,000-sq. meter economic houses in Luanda, capital of Angola, built by a Chinese company with US$11 million of interest-free loan from the Chinese government have been deeply welcomed by the Angolan people.After seeing what the Chinese government companies have done in Angola, President dos Santos more than once expressed his hope that more Chinese businessmen would come to Angola to invest, trade and participate in the reconstruction of the country.Angola, a country with rich natural resources such as oil and diamond, needs assistance from other countries including China for rebuilding, dos Santos said.As the trade between China and Angola is complementary, the bilateral economic cooperation will surely come to a new high in the process of reconstructing Angola.Document BDU0000020031124dzbo0000p ","Unset","","","Unset","","Unset","Unset","","Angola","

'Information and Communication Technology is probably the single most important tool one can embrace other than education, for development. Poverty is rooted in ignorance,' he said.One of the avenues is to see the price of a single computer go down to about $100 (Shs170, 000). Currently the market price of a brand new PC is rated at Shs1.5 million ($882) and Shs800, 000 ($470) depending on the type and durability.In Uganda there about with a population close to 30 million people, about 120,000 people can get access to a PC but only 25,000 are registered by the subscribers with all the Internet Service Providers (ISPs).Mr Bitature said: 'Uganda still has the opportunity to exploit the ICTs fully to reduce on the over dependency on agriculture to at least 50 percent'.The government recently scrapped off Value Added Tax on computer imports to increase computer availability in the country.Currently the national fibre-optic backbone infrastructure is being rolled out at a cost of more than $106 million (Shs175 billion).

Chinese President Hu Jintao has put forward proposals for developing sustainable relationship between China and Gabon. The Chinese leader held talks Wednesday in Beijing with visiting Gabonese President El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba. He said China is ready to work with Gabon to maintain the good momentum of the development of bilateral relations. In order to promote these relations, Hu proposed that the two countries push forward political communications and people-to-people exchanges, saying the two sides should further exchange mutual understanding and friendship so as to lay a solid foundation for the long-term development of bilateral relations. Secondly, President Hu said the two countries should further tap into the potential of trade and economic cooperation and expand the scale of cooperation. He said China will continue to encourage strong and prestigious Chinese enterprises to invest and do business in Gabon. He hoped the two sides will reinforce cooperation in such resources development areas as oil, mining and reforestation. Also he hoped that both sides explore such cooperative areas as agriculture, water conservation and fishing. Thirdly, President Hu said the two countries should deepen exchanges and cooperation in such fields as education, culture and public health; and step up collaboration in human resources development under the framework of the China-Africa Forum. Finally, Hu insisted that the two countries should give a bigger role to the political consultation mechanism between their foreign ministries so as to maintain sound cooperation and coordination on international affairs. President Bongo agreed with Hu on his comments on bilateral relations. He reiterated Gabon's stance on firmly sticking to the one-China policy and its support to China's cause of reunification. President Bongo briefed Hu about the current situation of Africa and the existing hot issues. Noting that China is a true friend of Africa, he said Gabon and other African states wish to deepen cooperation with China and hope that China will play a bigger role in resolving the hot issues in Africa. After the talks, the two presidents attended the signing ceremony of some documents between their governments, including the agreement on economic, technological cooperation and an aid package of $ 5 million (about CFA 2.7 billion) granted by Beijing for for development projects in Gabon.

"848","China","11 million dollar interest-free loan for economic houses in Luanda (Duplicate)","2003","true","BDU English Copyright 2003 China Daily Information Company. All rights reserved. China and Angola, despite the long distance between the two countries, have been enjoying good relations especially in the field of economy and trade. The economic cooperation between the Asian and African nations could date back to 1983 when the bilateral diplomatic relationship was established. However, due to the 27-year civil war in Angola, the economic ties have not been fully developed although there were some Chinese companies doing business in Angola before the end of the war in April last year. Since early 1990s, the trade between the two countries began to develop gradually. In 2000, the trade volume reached US$1.876 billion compared with US$150 million in 1995. According to some estimation, the trade volume could stand at US$2 billion this year as the first nine months have seen it reaching US$1.7 billion. In order to accelerate the reconstruction of country after the civil war, the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has put forward an 'economic diplomacy' policy to attract foreign investment and technology and further develop trade with other countries. Two projects funded by the Chinese government on rebuilding the telecommunication network in three Angolan provinces and repairing some parts of Angolan railways have been carried out in October and November this year respectively. Besides, the Chinese government also provided Angola with economic aid in terms of grants and interest-free loans to the African country to help the displaced. The 15,000-sq. meter economic houses in Luanda, capital of Angola, built by a Chinese company with US$11 million of interest-free loan from the Chinese government have been deeply welcomed by the Angolan people. After seeing what the Chinese government companies have done in Angola, President dos Santos more than once expressed his hope that more Chinese businessmen would come to Angola to invest, trade and participate in the reconstruction of the country. Angola, a country with rich natural resources such as oil and diamond, needs assistance from other countries including China for rebuilding, dos Santos said. As the trade between China and Angola is complementary, the bilateral economic cooperation will surely come to a new high in the process of reconstructing Angola.

This Year, Founding President Sam Nujoma paid his thirteenth visit to China and President Pohamba will attend the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Summit. These visits have been a big driving force for the development of the friendly cooperation between China and Namibia.Secondly, bilateral economic cooperation and trade have been developing steadily with fruitful results. Since the two countries established diplomatic ties, China has undertaken projects like the Children's Day Care Centre, low-cost houses and a pumping station at Aussenkehr.In April this year, China handed over the two regional council buildings, constructed with Chinese grants, to Namibia.

Funds will be used to upgrade and expand Ghana Telecom’s networks, financing the import of equipment from Alcatel Shanghai Bell. The loan is insured by Sinosure, the Chinese export credit agency. SG CIB acted as sole arranger, hedging bank and lender.Ghana Telecom was represented by Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft, while Afrinvest, a management-owned investment banking firm based in London, provided financial advice.Ghana Telecom is 70% owned by the government of Ghana and is a key client of SG-SSB, SG CIB’s subsidiary in Ghana. The remaining 30% is owned by G-Com, a consortium headed by Telekom Malaysia. Ghana Telecom is operated by Telenor Management Partners, a subsidiary of the Norwegian telecommunications firm, which agreed a management services agreement with the government of Ghana.The company also completed a $60 million receivables-backed syndicated term loan facility in late 2003. Cadwalader provided legal advice on the deal, with funds provided by a syndicate of international and domestic banks led by Barclays Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. Ghana Telecom was at the time also planning a Sinosure facility, but this was delayed while the telecom operator was forced to settle a dispute with Telekom Malaysia and G-Com. An out-of-court settlement was reached earlier this year, allowing the financing to go ahead.This rare transaction is not the first time Sinosure has guaranteed exports to Africa. SG CIB and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) jointly arranged a buyer credit supporting Chinese telecoms exports to Africa in a deal for Algérie Télécom in late 2003 (see Trade Finance March 2004 page 29). The Chinese exporter in that $40 million, 6.5-year transaction was ZTE.

The deal involves a three-stage investment and an agreement for Shandong to buy 10 million tonnes of iron ore per year at discounted prices, which sent shares soaring by 19.5%. The deal should enable African Minerals Ltd to accelerate the development of Tonkolili by boosting production, according to Executive Chairman Rank Timis. The new funds should also allow an improvement in the planned infrastructure so that all transport will be on rail, instead of a mix with road haulage.African Minerals said the proceeds from the deal will be used to build a railway line linking the mine and the port. The railway will be completed in the fall of 2011, and the first delivery of iron ore will take place in the fourth quarter of the same year.In February 2012, China's National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC) approved Shandong Iron and Steel's proposed $1.5 billion investment in African Minerals' Tonkolili project.

"11419","China","Grant to Namibia","2007","false","Chinese benefaction to Namibia in particular held steadfast on Monday when President Hu Jintao announced a N$1-billion soft loan and also offered N$60 million in the form of an interest-free loan, a grant and dozens of scholarships.Hu made the announcement in Windhoek during the fifth leg of his marathon tour of eight African countries some of which have received substantial sums of money in aid while in the same vein benefiting from debt-cancellation from the Asian giant.Hu said during talks with President Hifikepunye Pohamba that China would further avail US$100 million in buyers' credit and build youth-training centres in Namibia.Because Namibia is among the few African countries officially designated a tourism destination by the Chinese government, some of the money would go towards boosting its market share of the rapidly expanding Chinese tourism industry, particularly group tours.During the official talks on Monday that preceded the signing ceremony for the soft loans and other bilateral aid, Pohamba told his counterpart that Namibia has numerous opportunities for investment in the fields of agriculture, tourism, aquaculture, mining, energy, technology and infrastructure and human development.'In this regard, we are inviting Chinese entrepreneurs to come and form joint ventures and other business partnerships with their Namibian counterparts for the mutual benefit of both countries,' Pohamba said at the meeting held with Hu at a local hotel.He assured Chinese investors that they have nothing to fear because Namibia offers a conducive business environment in line with the Reciprocal Treaty on the Promotion and Protection of Investment signed by the two nations.China's tremendous economic and social growth, elevating it to a global economic powerhouse, was also commended by President Pohamba who said Namibia 'would like to emulate' the Asian nation's successes and learn from 'your tremendous experience'.'Namibia needs partners in the promotion and realization of industrial development, investment and local value addition which are all critical for the achievement of our national development goals as set out in our National Development Plans and Vision 2030,' the Head of State said at a meeting that included several cabinet ministers.He said the recent Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation reached common ground on major international political and economic issues, especially on the reform of the United Nations and the maintenance of international peace and security.'Namibia supports the China-Africa policy, which is based on peaceful co-existence and anchored on the values of sincerity, equality and mutual common development,' he said.And Namibia being a member of the Troika of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security, shall continue to support regional efforts aimed at conflict prevention.And equally important Pohamba reaffirmed his government's full support 'for the one-China policy and to reiterate our position that Taiwan is an integral part of China.'Hu said the cooperation between Namibia and China has been growing steadfastly in the fields of politics, economics, education, public health and culture.Since taking office in March 2005, Pohamba has actively promoted bilateral ties with China, and according to the news agency AP, trade between the two nations in the first 11 months of 2006 amounted to US$240 million, an increase of 103 percent from 2005.Hu, whose 130-strong delegation included his wife Liu Yongqing and several senior ministers and high-ranking officials, left yesterday morning for South Africa.//CHINA has offered Government one billion Namibian dollars as a concessional loan over a three-year period until 2010, plus another N$720 million as a credit line, The Namibian established yesterday.The offer was made on Monday during bilateral talks shortly before Chinese President Hu Jintao wrapped up his brief visit of barely 23 hours to Namibia yesterday morning.After talks with Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba on Monday, a new grant and an interest-free loan agreement worth N$60 million were signed at a brief public signing ceremony.The state visit culminated with a banquet held in honour of Hu and his 130-member delegation.The Permanent Secretary in the Finance Ministry confirmed the huge amount yesterday afternoon.'The N$1 billion is in the form of a concessional loan, which means that Namibia can use those funds on projects it will decide on,' Calle Schlettwein told The Namibian.'The second offer of US$ 00 million (about N$720 million) is a concessional credit line.This will enable our Government to acquire goods, services and equipment from China,' Schlettwein added.He said Government still had to decide whether it would accept the offer.'We will then have to decide on which projects we will use those funds and then negotiate the loan terms,' he explained.After Hu's departure, the two countries issued a joint communique, but the loan offer was not mentioned.Namibia and China expressed their satisfaction with the strong ties that exist between them as well as political trust and good co-operation.'Both heads of state recognised the achievements made in trade and agreed to work together to strengthen co-operation in mining, agriculture, tourism, manufacturing and human resources development,' the communique stated.Both countries now have four agreements in place: trade and economic co-operation, establishing a joint commission on trade and economic co-operation, a reciprocal treaty for the protection of trade and investments for both Chinese and Namibian businesspeople in China and Namibia.The fourth agreement was signed in Beijing last November during the Forum for China-Africa Co-operation (Focac).The Namibia Investment Centre and a similar institution in China, the China investment Promotion Agency (CIPA), agreed to promote and facilitate investment between the two countries.After Hu left, some 35 Chinese businesspeople who are part of his official delegation remained behind in Windhoek for a business presentation on Namibia as an investment destination.It was organised by the Namibia Investment Centre and the Ministry of Trade and Industry and some 50 Namibian captains of industry attended the session.Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko called on the Chinese executives to form joint ventures with their Namibian counterparts and to invest in local value addition of the country's raw materials.'It is imperative that during all your deliberations and interactions, value addition should become your central strategy of engagement,' Ngatjizeko urged.//Mar 27, 2007 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) --GOVERNMENT will engage a Chinese software company to install an electronic management system for the public service.Cabinet approved that the Office of the Prime Minister could secure funding under a concessional loan agreement signed last month between China and Namibia during the state visit of Chinese president Hu Jintao for the implementation of an Electronic Documentation and Records Management System (EDRMS) across the public service.This is viewed as a critical project in terms of existing e-governance policy directives.China offered over N$1 billion as a loan for projects to be identified by Namibia.The EDRMS project team evaluated various appropriate software solutions and found that the system offered by Chinese outfit CA-China SS Software Technology would be best suited for the requirements of the Namibian public service.'The system is not only government user friendly, but also offers easy-to-use interfaces and robust application software that will link up with already familiar public service platforms to ensure records and archival compliance,' Information Minister Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah told reporters last week.Cabinet therefore endorsed the EDRMS under the auspices of the Office of the Prime Minister on condition that it complies with tender procedures.Cabinet instructed the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Commission to discuss the conditions, terms, modality of accessing the preferential loan and credit facility to finance the EDRMS and other priority projects in Namibia with the Chinese Government.Cabinet also granted approval for the arrangement of the grant and the use of the concessional loans for the EDRMS project by the Export-Import Bank of China, subject to concurrence by the Chinese Government.The company CA-CSS is a joint venture formed by New York-based commercial software associates (CA) and China National Computer Software   Technology Service Corporation (CS S).The primary goal of the joint venture was to explore the huge potential presented by the Chinese software market by leveraging the resources and expertise from both parties.The company's head office is in Beijing, China.//Bilateral trade aside, the visit to Namibia in 2007 of Chinese President Hu Jintao during his historic tour of several African countries, resulted in China offering Namibia concessional loans amounting to RMB1 billion. And it also generously extended a preferential line of credit that is interest-free to the tune of US$100 million.From the concessional loan, an amount of RMB41 million was used for the procurement of software and for the implementation of the e-governance project for Namibia, while RMB300 million was used for the procurement of X-ray equipment from China.RMB645 million from the concessional loan funded three developmental projects including for the implementation of one of the phases of the Northern Railway Line as well as the upgrading of the Oshakati State Hospital in northern Namibia, which she noted: 'was very run down and needed to be upgraded'.Part of these funds was used to give a facelift and expansion of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), whose facilities were built during the colonial era.'The Namibian side is satisfied with the implementation of these projects,' she said.She said since her deployment as Chinese Ambassador to Namibia, she has worked tirelessly to ensure that the eight areas of cooperation measures promised by President Hu Jintao at the China Africa Summit held in Beijing in 2006 such as the provision of full support to African countries, that such as assistance to rural schools and hospitals are fulfilled.'Since I came to Namibia, I have been working very hard to implement the eight measures promised by President Hu Jintao at the China-Africa Beijing Summit. Since my arrival, my job was to consolidate different relations and to further the friendship and areas of cooperation. Since my arrival, our mutual trust has grown,' she said.The eight measures announced by the Chinese president included the doubling of grant assistance and providing US$3 billion soft loans and US$2 billion preferential buyer's credit in three years setting up a China-Africa development fund which will be injected with US$5 billion to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Africa.Other measures are: building a conference centre for the African Union, cancelling debts owed by heavily indebted and the least developed African countries, further opening up China's vast market to Africa by largely increasing the number of African export items to China that receive zero-tariff treatment and strengthening cooperation in the fields of agriculture, human resource enhancement, health and education.The inception of the Forum of China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) brought tangible benefits to Namibia such as the building of the regional council buildings in Rundu and Outapi, the New State House, the fishery laboratory at Kamutjonga Inland Fisheries Institute in Kavango, the Defence Academy (Okahandja), and the Youth Training Centre.China also availed grants amounting to RMB20 million and it helped to fund a large hospital at Omuthiya where a groundbreaking ceremony has occurred.She said China has provided over 300 training opportunities to Namibians in various fields while at the same time it has seconded a medical team at the Katutura State Hospital. There are several Chinese experts working at grassroots level while rural women and youth empowerment projects have all benefited from China's generosity.At current exchange rates, US$1 is equivalent to RMB6.8.//No18, 2011 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE Ministry of Works and Transport has drawn Government into taking a Chinese loan that was rejected two years ago as 'onerous' in a road-building contract that has also bypassed official open tender process.The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, George Simataa, told The Namibian that the construction of the two roads - between Omakange and Ruacana and between Omafo and Outapi in northern Namibia - will be funded with a Chinese loan but that the Ministry of Finance is yet to apply or approve the loan. The roads are expected to cost about N$1 billion.The Namibian has it on good authority that the loan in question is the same controversial package that the Government ditched in 2009 after Teko Trading, a company owned by two Namibians and a Chinese national now facing corruption charges, was exposed as having received kic-backs of N$120 million from China when the Government bought customs scanning equipment for N$550 million.Teko Trading was said to be the 'local representative' for Nuctech (the Chinese company) although the Ministry of Finance said it had no knowledge of the company's dubious middle-man role.Teko Trading, owned by Public Service Commissioner Teckla Lameck, Kongo Mokaxwa and Chinese national Yung Fan, were supposed to be the 'local representatives' for China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export, and were experted to earn at least 10 per cent 'commission' from the N$1,1 billion tender to complete the 65km northern railway line between Ondangwa and Oshikango.Government dropped that loan agreement, with then Permanent Secretary of Finance Calle Schlettwein calling it 'onerous' and Simataa arguing in documents that the loan was 'risky because of foreign exchange fluctuations'.In a series of e-mails this week, Simataa said two Chinese firms, China Gezhouba Group International Engineering and China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export, have been selected to build the two roads mentioned earlier.While his reply on Tuesday was categorical that the two companies were selected to do the job, after he was asked to elaborate or give definite answers, on Wednesday he changed saying they still have to negotiate and agree on pricing after which they will sign technical and framework agreements.'It is only at that stage that the Ministry of Finance will be approached to apply for a loan from the Chinese Government,' Simataaa said in an e-mail on Wednesday.Asked if it is a condition of the loan that the work be given to Chinese companies he was evasive, saying 'these are Chinese-financed projects. One of their conditions is that the projects should be carried [out] by Chinese firms'.Having already gone ahead with the project, Simataa would also not say for certain whether the ministry was given tender exemption for the work, saying only that proper tender regulations were followed. When pressed if the construction of the two roads were put out on official and open tender Simataa said 'no', citing Chinese loan conditions that Chinese companies be used on the projects. Simataa and the Ministry of Works have been named in research documents as the main culprits in regularly demanding and getting exemptions from public tender regulations.It is unclear why Simataa and the ministry have decided to return to the Chinese loan that they criticised a couple of years ago. There are no indications this time that Teko Trading would be involved.The China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export northern railway line contract was cancelled after it was challenged in the High Court because of alleged tender irregularities.","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Export credits","Unset","","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020070207e327000d2&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"11513","China","Simandou iron mine","2010","false","raised $15.2bn from a rights issue to form a production joint ventureSimandouIvanhoe MinesRio Tinto and Chinalco have resurrected plans jointly to develop a rich iron ore deposit in Guinea in the first of several moves aimed at repairing the Anglo-Australian miner's strained relationship with Beijing.Both parties are in late stage talks to develop Simandou, one of the world's highest-quality undeveloped iron ore concessions, according to a person close to the situation. Rio in 2008 estimated project development would cost $6bn but analysts now believe it could be closer to $12bn.Chinese steelmakers became Rio's most important customer by far last year. But Rio's relations with China froze last summer starting in June when the miner spurned a $19.5bn capital injection fromChinalco, a state-owned aluminium producer that remains Rio's largest shareholder.The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.The deal would have restored Rio's balance sheet in return for Chinalco taking board seats and stakes in top-tier Australian assets. Instead Rio dropped the deal and launched a $15.2bn rights issue and a joint venture with BHP Billiton.The joint development of Simandou was a feature of a broader 'strategic partnership' that would have accompanied the original Rio-Chinalco deal.Australia's relations with Beijing were further damaged in July when Stern Hu, Rio's executive iron ore salesman in China, and three associates were detained. The four executives were recently formally indicted on charges of taking bribes and their case will now proceed to trial.Discussions over Simandou come on the eve of a trip to Beijing by Tom Albanese, Rio's chief executive. Mr Albanese is on Monday due to address the China Development Forum where he will speak on strengthening global co-operation for a mutually beneficial future.Mr Albanese has maintained over the last few months that Rio's and China's interests are aligned over the long term: China needs iron ore, including from new sources like Simandou, to feed its steel mills, while Rio is the world's second-biggest producer of iron ore.A joint venture in Guinea would allow Rio to share political risk and Simandou's sizeable development costs. Simandou lies 750km from the sea with poor transport links and infrastructure.OPT cut Rio needs to build a customised railway to transport the ore to the coast as well as an export terminal.People close to the Mongolian mining industry have also said they beleived Rio and Chinalco are working out a deal on Oyu Tolgoi, the enormous Mongolian copper-gold deposit that is a joint venture between Rio and Ivanhoe Mines of Canada.Chinese companies including Shenhua have been jockeying to take concessions in Mongolia, an emerging mining province whose valuable coal and copper deposits are located in the southern Gobi desert near the Chinese border.Xiong Weiping, Chinalco's president, this week told Reuters that it hoped to participate in Oyu Tolgoi. 'Since Chinalco is the largest non-ferrous metal company in China, and China has a geographic advantage with Mongolia, we believe that having a big company like Chinalco involved would give some helpful impetus to the project,' he told Reuters.Rio executives have described Oyu Tolgoi as the most important undeveloped project in the company's global portfolio.,20100316_25240_264.xmlDocument FTCOM00020100316e63g002pa------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rio and Chinalco to share Guinea ore projectBy Peter Smith in Sydney608 words19 March 2010Financial Times (FT.Com)FTCOMEnglishCopyright 2010 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.Rio Tinto and Chinalco confirmed plans on Friday to form a partnership that will develop a rich iron ore deposit in Guinea in what is expected to be the first of a number of joint venture undertakings between the Anglo-Australian miner and its biggest shareholder.The Chinese state-owned aluminium producer said it will invest $1.35bn in the early stages of the Simandou project in return for a 47 per cent stake in a new company alongside Rio with 53 per cent. The partnership will cover mining as well as rail and port infrastructure in a project that analysts believe could cost $12bn to develop.News of the joint venture comes at a delicate time for Rio and China. Stern Hu, Rio's executive iron ore salesman in China, and three associates are due to face a Shanghai court starting Monday on charges they stole commercial secrets and took bribes.China's treatment of the Rio employees will be watched closely by the international business community, particularly those companies employing foreign nationals in the country. The trial also coincides with the arrival in China of Tom Albanese, Rio chief executive, who is due to speak at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Monday.The non-binding agreement to develop Simandou is a clear sign of growing ties between Rio andChinalco.The relationship soured nine months ago when Rio spurned a $19.5bn capital injection from Chinalcobefore launching a $15.2bn rights issue and agreeing a joint venture production company with BHP Billiton to develop its Western Australian iron ore operations.Rio's top management have made a series of references recently to work being done to extend theChinalco relationship.In a statement on Friday, Xiong Weiping, Chinalco president, said Simandou was a world-class iron ore project whose development would enhance economic and trade relations between China and Guinea.'A successful development of the Simandou project will effectively increase the global supply of iron ore, balance the global iron ore market structure and promote the long-term, stable and healthy development of the global iron ore mining industry,' he said.The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.In a client note, Citigroup said the Simandou deal signified a thawing in relations between Rio andChinalco.'Other logical deals to do include the development of Arakun as an extension of the Weipa bauxite mine [in Queensland, Australia] and potentially around the Oyu Tolgoi development in Mongolia,' Citigroupsaid.People close to the Mongolian mining industry have said they believe Rio and Chinalco are working out a deal on Oyu Tolgoi, a copper-gold deposit that is a joint venture between Rio and Ivanhoe Mines of Canada.Rio believes Simandou could become the world's third most important iron ore province outside Brazil and Australia. The miner currently estimates Simandou has 2.25bn tonnes of iron ore, but analysts atCitigroup say it could contain more than 4bn tonnes.It has also said the project could eventually supply steelmakers with up to 170m tonnes of iron ore a year, although the first phase of the mine's development targets 70m tonnes a year by 2018.Mr Xiong added the involvement of Chinalco and possibly Chinese infrastructure companies would accelerate Simandou's development and improve Guinea's local infrastructure.The Guinean government holds an option to buy up to 20 per cent of the project.Blackstone and China International Capital Corporation advised Chinalco on the transaction.20100319_13713_251.xmlDocument FTCOM00020100319e63j001jl---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chinalco and Rio sign $1.35bn Guinea dealBy William MacNamara in London676 words28 July 2010Financial Times (FT.Com)FTCOMEnglishCopyright 2010 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.Aluminum Corp of China and Rio Tinto signed a $1.35bn deal on Thursday that allows the Chinese state-owned miner to buy in to a rich iron ore project in Guinea, in a move that places both mining companies at the centre of multi-billion-dollar scramble for west Africa's iron ore.Rio and Chinalco - the common name of the Chinese miner - revealed few changes to the earlier agreement they signed in March over Simandou, the Guinean deposit. Chinalco will pay Rio $1.35bn that will fund project development. In return, Chinalco buys its way up to a 47 per cent stake in the Rio-Chinalco joint venture.Rio still disputes the boundaries of its Simandou concession. In 2008 the Guinean government stripped it of half of its Simandou rights, citing the miner's failure to develop a resource that could transform Guinea's export earnings.If Rio had its way, it would still control both the southern block of Simandou and the northern block, which is now controlled by Brazilian group Vale after its $2.5bn deal with Beny Steinmetz Group in April.But such controversies - significant to the economics of the deal - were nowhere to be seen on Thursday during an elaborate signing ceremony in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.Pomp, champagne, flowery speeches, and photo opportunities signalled a return to warmer relations between Rio and Chinalco, Rio's largest shareholder.The language of the speeches was reminiscent of those that accompanied Rio and Chinalco's $19.5bninvestment deal in 2008. The highly controversial deal, which would have given Chinalco board seats and a higher shareholding in Rio, fell apart amid opposition from the Rio shareholder base. The deal's demise did much to to make relations between the two companies either sour or awkward, according to different sources close to Rio.Chinalco is controlled by the Chinese state. China is Rio's biggest customer, and its purchases of Australian iron ore in particular drive Rio's profits.'Developing our relationship and business links with China is a key priority for Rio Tinto,' said Jan du Plessis, Rio's chairman, in the Beijing ceremony also attended by Tom Albanese, chief executive, and Sam Walsh, chief of the iron ore division. 'This agreement takes our relationship with China and our largest Chinalco to a new level.'Simandou has among the largest untapped iron ore deposits in the world, with some 2.25bn tonnes.The Guinean government has an option to buy a 20 per cent stake in the project. 'The government has recently expressed a willingness to exercise that option,' Rio said. This would mean that no company had an outright majority share in Simandou, although Rio will be project operator. The World Bank'sInternational Finance Corporation is also a shareholder.The $1.35bn investment will not cover all of the infrastructure-spending needed to make Simandou viable. Rio engineers were studying the best routes for a new railway through the mountains of the Guinean interior and building a new port near Conakry, the capital.The flurry of investment in west African iron ore appears to be starting a new infrastructure-building boom in the poor and previously war-torn states of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Vale has plans to build a new port at Didia in Liberia, while ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, is refurbishing the port of Buchanan in Liberia and UK-listed African Minerals is building a new port at Pepel near Freetown in Sierra Leone. These and other companies are planning to build new railways linking the deposits with the coast.Before the Rio-Chinalco venture was confirmed, some mining bankers and analysts had speculated that it might involve Oyu Tolgoi. This Mongolian copper deposit, near China's border, has also been rumoured as the site of a potential Rio-Chinalco joint venture. Ivanhoe Mines owns the project, but Rio is a large minority shareholder.20100728_13625_171.xmlDocument FTCOM00020100729e67s0035x---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Team China begins to swing its weightJOHN GARNAUT930 words17 May 2011The AgeAGEEFirst8English© 2011 Copyright John Fairfax Holdings Limited. www.theage.com.au [http://www.theage.com.au]In January, Xiong received the most important regulatory approval, from the National Development   Reform Commission. In February, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi dropped into Guinea capital Conakry and received an extraordinary reception.'We are following China's road of opening and reform, just like Deng Xiaoping did for China in the past,' President Alfa Conde told Yang, according to Phoenix Television. 'For the moment, what is important is not only what China can bring to Guinea but also what Guinea can give China.'Last month, Vice-Minister for Commerce Fu Ziying toured Guinea and returned to scold Western journalists who asked whether China's generous development aid was linked to its appetite for resources.'Who are the largest iron ore owners?' he said. 'Not Chinese, but Western countries who colonised the place.'A week later, Fu took off his overseas aid hat and told the China Daily about what he had been doing in Guinea: 'There are preferential policies tailored for Chinese companies under the new mining law.'The China Daily also interviewed President Conde: 'We will open the door widely to Chinese companies and provide what China needs.'Chinalco is demonstrating that it holds the political cards in Guinea. It is about to demonstrate that it has the financier, the infrastructure developers and guaranteed buyers for every boatload of iron ore that Simandou can produce.Xiong has sewn up all the finance he needs from the China-Africa Development Fund — essentially a division of the China Development Bank. He has organised a consortium tipped to include Baosteel, China Railway Construction Corporation and a port-building company that will be unveiled after gaining final approval from the Ministry of Commerce and the foreign exchange regulator.In short, Xiong Weiping is setting up the most formidable demonstration of 'Team China' that the investment world has seen. Lately, Xiong has been telling colleagues that he intends to build Chinalco into one of the world's top-five mining companies.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Baosteel Has interests in Simandou Iron Ore Projectwww.yicai.com211 words23 May 2011SinoCast Energy BeatSCEB1EnglishCopyright 2011 SinoCast LLC.

Baosteel's participation will help to ensure stable sales in the future when demands for iron ores shrink.Chalco will invest USD 1.35 billion in phases in the coming years so as to gain a 47 percent stake in the venture project finally, in terms of an agreement it signed with Rio Tinto in July last year.Baosteel Group Corporation, the second-biggest mill in China, has been acquiring resources worldwide in recent years. The company bought a 15 percent stake in Australia traded Aquila Resources Ltd. at AUD 286 million, turning into the second majority shareholder, in 2009; it then took over a 9.9 percent stake in Canada's Noront Resources at CAD 17.40 million this year.SinoCast LLCDocument SCEB000020110523e75n0000a-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DJ Chalco: To Form Chinese Conglomerate To Develop Simandou Iron Ore Project210 words28 November 201108:19 AMDow Jones Chinese Financial WireDJCFWEEnglishCopyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones   Company, Inc.BEIJING (Dow Jones)--Aluminum Corp. of China (2600.HK), or Chalco, will form a conglomerate with several Chinese companies including Baosteel Group Corp., China's second-largest steelmaker by output, to jointly develop the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, Chalco's parent Chinalco said in a statement Monday.The conglomerate will also include China Railway Construction Corporation Ltd., China-Africa Development Fund and China Communications Construction Co., it said.The conglomerate will participate in the project's construction and some of the iron ore sales.Rio Tinto formally established a joint venture with Chalco in April.

All Rights Reserved.JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) - Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi began a two-day visit to South Africa Monday, marking 10 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Yang paid a brief courtesy visit to President Thabo Mbeki before meeting with foreign affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma in Pretoria. It was the start of a tour of Africa, where China foreign ministry officials have traditionally started the year in a sign of the importance they place on the resource-rich continent.Yang was also to visit Congo, Burundi and Ethiopia.Yang said the China-South Africa relationship is 'of great importance,' the South African Press Association reported.Since South Africa, the continent's economic powerhouse, dropped Taipei for Beijing 10 years ago, China has become the country's largest trading partner.Trade between South Africa, the continent's economic powerhouse and a major gold-producing country, and China reached US$240 million in the first 11 months of 2006, an increase of 34.5 percent from the previous year.Last year China's biggest bank, the state-owned Industrial   Commercial Bank of China Ltd. bought a 20 percent stake in South Africa's biggest lender, Standard Bank Group Ltd. in one of China's biggest foreign corporate acquisitions to date.Chinese investments into South Africa amount to US$130 million, mostly in a chromium mine while South African investments in China stand at about US$400 million including investments by Anglo American, SAB Miller and a US$120 million investment by a property group.Yang's visit comes a year after Chinese President Hu Jintao visited South Africa in early 2007.South Africa and China on Monday established a diplomatic mechanism to enhance political, economic and trade relations.Yang and Dlamini Zuma were also expected to discuss co-operation between the two countries in international affairs as well as Chinese support for peacekeeping operations in Africa.7Document APRS000020080107e41700378","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","South Africa","","0","Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), State-Owned Company","","Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), State-Owned Company","1","Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd., Private Sector","1","Raw","0","OOF-like","3","Unset","","Inactive","2","","","","","","","","","","","1","South Africa","560","218","South Africa","ZAF","ZA","710","199","Commercial","1","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

The project is already running behind schedule by three years after it stalled owing to a lack of funding. “The Southern Bypass project is part of greater efforts by government to provide enhanced road infrastructure to guarantee economic development as spelt out in the Vision 2030 document,” says Kenya’s Minister of Roads, Franklin Bett. Chinese construction company China Road   Bridge Corporation has been awarded the contract to undertake the project, which will take 36 months to complete.The Southern Bypass is touted as a critical project in easing traffic congestion in Kenya’s capital city, as it will divert traffic from the city centre.The road diverts from the Mombasa–Kisumu highway near Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and rejoins the highway at Limuru on the outskirts of Nairobi. The bypass forms part of vital road infrastructure projects identified by the Kenya government as key in driving the realisation of its Vision 2030, which seeks to transform the East African nation into a middle- income economy.Other major road projects in Kenya being implemented by Chinese companies include the $312,5-million Thika super highway and the Eastern and Northern bypasses, being constructed at a cost of $106-million.

According to figures obtained by Steel Business Briefing from the Arab Iron   Steel Union (AISU), China became SNIM’s second largest export market in 2007.This was the first time that a non-European country has been such an important customer of the Mauritanian miner. European steel companies normally take more than 90% of SNIM’s exports, but in 2007 this declined to 81%.SNIM exported 11.8m tonnes of iron ore in 2007. France was its largest market with 2.7m t. China came next with 2.17m tonnes.In 2006, only 4% of SNIM’s 11.1m tonnes of production went to China – less than 450,000t. But in 2007, as SBB reported, two Chinese companies signed long-term contracts with SNIM – Minmetals for 1.5m t/y for seven years, and Laiwu Steel for 1m t/y for five years.The AISU also reports that SNIM is aiming to increase its production to 12.4m t in 2008, up from 11.9m t in 2007. The company aims to raise its production capacity to 14m t in 2010.Its joint project with Australia’s Sphere Investments and Qatar Steel to build a 7m t/y iron ore pellet plant should start up in the second half of 2011.For questions about editorial content, or to subscribe call +44 (0) 20 7626 0600, info@steelbb.com© Steel Business Briefing 2008 ","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Mauritania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=STSCNW0020080520e45d0000u&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Istyle='BACKGROUND-COLOR:#FFFF00'>n September 2010, the Shanghai Construction Company announced its intentions to build two new regional hospitals in Wa and Kumasi as part of the Chinese government's 'Better Ghana' initiative. Large proportions of the funds for these projects are grants from Beijing, such as a hospital in Accra that was built at a cost of US$13mn with a Chinese grant of US$7.5mn, before being handed to the Ghanaian government. Other gifts include offering scholarships to Ghanaians to receive training in China and flying doctors to the country to help develop Ghana's health strategy.These gifts and concessions appear to be part of a long-term hearts and minds strategy that has recently come to fruition. At the same time as the Shanghai Construction Company announced that it was to build two hospitals, Ghana and China signed a US$9bn set of loans. The first tranche of this loan is valued at US$3bn and is to be released shortly. The Ghanaian government has said the repayments for these large loans will not come from the national budget, but from exports. Although not explicitly mentioned, the exports will be raw materials such as oil, gas and minerals.Ghana welcomes the investment that China is able to put into its economy because, like many African countries, it has struggled to obtain loans from the World Bank and the IMF for much-needed infrastructure projects, as these come with stringent terms and conditions. In return, China receives access to much-needed raw materials. The gifts and aid that Beijing has given Ghana so far are dwarfed by the mutual benefits of the US$15bn of loans and trade deals that have followed.…Business Monitor InternationalDocument BMIPME0020110813e78c00001","Health","Hospital Construction","","Implementation","2","Unset","Unset","","Ghana","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BMIPME0020110813e78c00001&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Any unauthorised reproduction is strictly prohibited.China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) is set to start testing operations this week on its Saha-1 wildcat in Niger, which could hold 200 million barrels of oil, writes Iain Esau.According to minority partner TG World Energy, plans are in hand 'to complete bottom-hole operations and rig up for testing which is anticipated to begin within the next few days'.Saha lies in the 71,000 square kilometre Tenere permit, where CNPC International holds an 80% stake with the remaining interest held by Calgary-based minnow TG World.CNPC said delays happened when running logs between about 2500 metres depth in the probe and its target depth at 3500 metres.The operator has identified four intervals that will be tested during an operation that is expected to last until towards the end of this month, a couple of weeks longer than anticipated.Before drilling began CNPC had interpreted three prospective horizons - Sokor, Madama and Yogou - which between them contained potential likely resources of about 200 million barrels of oil, split fairly evenly.Follow up exploration wells are earmarked on the West Fachi prospect, which has about 96 million barrels of potential held in a horizon at more than 4000 metres, 500 metres deeper than Saha.Both prospects are sited in a northern extension of the Dinga Trough, which has proved to be prospective for oil in the Agadem permit to the south.Saha and West Fachi lie in the south of the Tenere permit and are the closest prospects to Agadem, where Malaysia's Petronas and US supermajor ExxonMobil have previously found more than 350 million barrels of reserves.ExxonMobil has withdrawn from Agadem, after failing to reach an agreement with the Niger government on its future participation and an extension to the licence beyond May last year.Petronas is still thought to be in talks with the Niamey government to retain an interest in the prospective licence.However, Ousseini Assane Boureima, exploration boss at Niamey's Department of Mines   Energy, told Upstream late last year that a number of Chinese companies have been in talks with Niger to secure access to the block.If CNPC is one of these players and manages to secure a stake in Tenere, a multi-field development could be on the cards.Document UPSTRM0020070208e3290002b","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Niger","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=UPSTRM0020070208e3290002b&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

(Duplicate)","2009","false","BIDJAN (Dow Jones)--Iory Coast state mining company, Sodemi signed a partnership agreement Wednesday with China National Geological   Mining Corp., or CGM, to develop a state manganese ore mine in the southwest.According to the director-general of Sodemi, Jean Likane-Yagui, the partnership with CGM will boost production at the Lauzoua site from the current 150,000 to 200,000 metric tons to 300,000 tons by 2011, and 500,000 tons by 2013.'China represents our main market for manganese ore at the moment, so it was only logical to work with a Chinese mining company,' said Likane-Yagui.Sodemi says the site has certified reserves of 1.4 million tons.The partnership deal gives 51% to Sodemi, 39% to CGM and 10% to the state.The agreement will also see the construction of a ferromanganese factory at the site with an initial capacity of 50,000 tons per year, with the possibility of an extension to 165,000 tons.'This signature shows the interest international investors have in our country as we leave behind the years of civil war. Iory Coast is open to all investors to exploit the riches of our mineral reserves,' said Minister of Mines and Energy Leon Monnet.Trade with China has more than doubled, from 50 billion CFA francs, or $112.6 million, to 112 billion CFA francs in 2008.Chinese companies are particularly active in transport and construction, with various building projects including a new presidential palace in the capital Yamoussoukro and a new hospital in President Laurent Gbagbo's hometown, Gagnoa.The other main manganese mine is in the northeast at Bondoukou and run by the Indian firm Taurian.So far this year, Iory Coast has exported 74,822 metric tons of manganese ore, down 32,176 tons, or 30%, from the 106,998 tons shipped up to this point last year, according to official port data.Iory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer, but the minerals and hydrocarbons sector is increasingly important.","Unset","","","Unset","","Unset","Unset","","Gabon","","0","","","","","","","Raw","0","Unset","1","Unset","","Inactive","2","","","","","","","","","","","1","Gabon","481","239","Gabon","GAB","GA","266","646","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

The terminal will be developed and operated by a joint venture between Airports of Mauritius and Aéroports de Paris Management. Aéroports de Paris Engineering will be responsible for the design and engineering of the new terminal, which hopefully will increase the airport’s annual capacity from 1m to 4m passengers. The new terminal will be built by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. The project is being financed by a concessionary loan from the Export and Import Bank of China, and is further evidence of China’s strategic interest in Mauritius as a gateway to Africa.This project is a key component of the government’s plans to expand infrastructure and support the expansion of the tourist sector. The state-of-the-art terminal is planned to be a visual statement of confidence. The present terminal at SSR is saturated and often operates at 160% of capacity, with bottlenecks in all passenger-processing zones.

"1836","China","Duplicate: Oil Mining License","2006","false","See ID# 196'Energy-hungry China last month snapped up more oil and gas assets, this time with state-owned international investment conglomerate Citic Group paying $1.91 billion for the Karazhanbas field in Kazakhstan (p13). The purchase follows Sinopec's acquisition of 50% of independent Omimex's assets in Colombia for $800 million in a joint deal with India's Oil   Natural Gas Corp. The deals, coupled with the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) purchase of a 45% stake in deepwater OML 130 in Nigeria for $2.27 billion earlier this year, highlight the increasing financial clout of Chinese companies in their aggressive hunt for oil.According to Yan Qifa, vice general manager of the economic research unit at the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), 'oil and gas development projects in foreign countries are complex and require more procedures,' which explains why the Chinese state oil firms have at their disposal a few financing alternatives. 'In general, we have direct loans for investment overseas, foreign aid to developing countries and favorable export buyer's credit with oil and gas as returns,' he said.The main national export credit agencies involved in these transactions are Eximbank and -- to a smaller extent -- the China Development Bank, which have been supporting domestic companies in their overseas exploits since the mid-1990s. Both were created in 1994 to facilitate direct loans to state companies.China Eximbank has been charged with the task of implementing state policies in industry, foreign trade and economy, finance and foreign affairs, and is the third largest export credit agency in the world. With abundant resources, the banks are able to bestow extremely favorable terms of credit that are unlikely to be matched in the market. According to sources, the interest rate on funds provided to enterprises investing abroad can be about 3% lower than that offered by commercial banks. 'It may not be profitable for the export credit agencies to provide such favorable loans, but with $1 trillion of foreign reserves, China can afford it,' said one source in Beijing. As of late last year, Eximbank has provided a total of $300 billion in financing to Chinese companies.' 'BEIJING (Dow Jones)--China National Offshore Oil Corp. is in talks to secure right of first refusal on oil blocks to be offered in an international tender by Nigeria - the latest step in its scramble for African assets.Edmund Daukoru, Nigeria's oil minister, told Dow Jones Newswires that the blocks were set to be made available to China's largest offshore oil producer by output in return for an investment package financed by a $2.5 billion loan.An agreement could see CNOOC granted 'lifting rights' on commercial terms from fields in Nigeria for the first time, he said. This would enable CNOOC to ship crude oil back to China to feed the nation's fast-growing economy.China is the world's second-largest consumer of oil and has been ramping up efforts to diversify its sources of crude away from the instability-prone Middle East, with Premier Wen Jiabao leading the latest in a string of high-profile delegations to oil-rich African nations in June.'They (CNOOC) would have preferred to negotiate directly, but we would like the value to come out not by negotiation but through a market competitive process,' Daukoru said during a three-day visit to China.This process involves holding a tender to establish the market value of the blocks rather than an outright discretionary allocation, he said. CNOOC would then have right of first refusal to match the top bid.But Daukoru, who is also president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, did not reveal the location or the number of blocks being considered as part of the deal.Negotiations followed the signing of a memorandum of understanding earlier this year on expanding economic cooperation between the two countries and a final deal should be signed when Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo visits China in November, Daukoru said.In March, CNOOC bought a 35% working interest in a license to explore for oil offshore Nigeria for $60 million, and Chairman Fu Chengyu named Nigeria alongside Myanmar as the two countries where his company wanted to focus its investment in the medium term.Two months earlier, CNOOC agreed to pay $2.27 billion, plus $424 million in expenses, to South Atlantic Petroleum Ltd for a 45% working interest in the OML 130 offshore oil mining license, which mainly covers Nigeria's undeveloped Akpo field.Its activity has been mirrored by state-owned rivals China National Petroleum Corp., the parent company of PetroChina Co. (PTR) and China Petrochemical Corp., or Sinopec Group, which have also been snapping up upstream assets in Africa.'CNOOC is very aggressive. I'm very impressed by that,' said Daukoru.'They are very committed to the kind of undertaking which we are trying to get out of them and in return for which will be oil blocks (and) perhaps crude oil lifting rights on commercial terms.'A $2.5 billion loan has been offered by the Export and Import Bank of China and CNOOC would be expected to cover a large chunk of the interest rate on repayments in return for a deal, Daukoru said.He added: 'By November everything can be agreed and we can sign off on the blocks and the loan is ready for draw down hopefully.'A spokesman for CNOOC could not be reached for comment.Daukoru's whistlestop visit to China included a tour of a fertilizer plant on the southern island of Hainan as Nigeria is known to need more fertilizer for its agriculture sector, which is the mainstay of local communities.Although details have not been finalized, Daukoru said a 'judicious mix' of projects including building fertilizer plants and investment in refineries would be financed by the overall loan put up by the Chinese.Nigeria has suffered sporadic outbreaks of violence against oil infrastructure such as pipelines as communities express anger at the perceived plundering of national oil wealth by overseas firms and the lack of benefits flowing back to the grassroots.Around 600,000 barrels per day of Nigerian crude oil output - or one-fifth of its total capacity - is currently shut in because of sabotage, Daukoru said.Chinese firms have been keen to cut deals that involve investment in infrastructure projects if it means they overtake overseas rivals in acquiring African assets.In May, CNPC - the largest oil producer in China by assets - secured four oil blocks in Nigeria in a deal that also saw it agree to invest $2 billion in the Kaduna refinery there.Nigerian crude is a high-quality light, low sulfur grade referred to as sweet, and is highly prized by oil consuming nations because of its high gasoline content and relatively cheap processing costs. ''BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) - China National Offshore Oil Company Limited (CNOOC Ltd.) said Monday that oil and gas production in Nigeria's OML130 project, of which CNOOC Ltd. holds a 45-percent interest, has begun ahead of the planned start-up date.Akpo, an oil formation under the OML130 drilling license, was discovered in 2000. The area is located 200 kilometers from the Nigerian coastline in water depth ranging from 1,200 to 1,400 meters. Akpo's proved and probable reserves are estimated to be around 620 millions barrels of condensate.The development facilities consist of 44 wells, including 22 producers, 20 water injectors, two gas injectors, a floating production storage offloading facility (FPSO) with a designed daily processing capacity of 185,000 barrels of oil and a storage capacity of two million barrels, 110 kilometers subsea pipelines and other infrastructures.To date, 22 wells have been drilled, according to CNOOC Ltd. CNOOC Ltd. acquired a 45-percent working interest of the OML 130 in 2006 for nearly 2.3 billion U.S. dollars.Akpo is expected to reach its plateau rate of approximately 175,000 barrels of oil per day during summer 2009, said sources with CNOOC Ltd.As one of the leading projects with huge potential in Western Africa, and one of the largest deep water projects ever undertaken, Akpo is expected to become the most important new oil field of this year, said Fu Chengyu, Chairman and Chief Executive of CNOOC Ltd.For CNOOC Ltd., the successful start-up of Akpo will enhance the weight of overseas assets in the company's total portfolio by a substantial increase of its overseas reserves and production, said Fu.French oil company Total acts as the operator of OML 130 block. Other partners in the project include Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Petrobras of Brazil and South Atlantic Petroleum Limited of Nigeria.Incorporated in Hong Kong, CNOOC Ltd. is a listed subsidiary of China National Offshore Oil Corporation, China's largest offshore oil producer.Enditem'","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Implementation","2","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Nigeria","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=IPF0000020061212e2b700007&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The current status and start and end dates are unknown.KAMPALA, Uganda (Dow Jones)--The Chinese government has pledged to boost Uganda's fight against Somalia's al Qaeda-inspired al Shabab militants, who claimed responsibility for the terror attacks in Kampala last year that left at least 79 people dead, officials said Tuesday.The Chinese minister of national defense, General Liang Guanglie, signed two protocols with his Ugandan counterpart, Crispus Kiyonga, in Kampala in which China offered to extend at least 25 million yuan ($3.9 million) for the Ugandan army's operations in war-torn Somalia, Defense Minister Kiyonga said.'We analyzed the regional and international security situation and agreed to strengthen our cooperation,' Kiyonga told Dow Jones Newswires in a telephone interview. 'The funds will be used to acquire transport equipment for the UPDF (Ugandan army) and support operations in Somalia.'The latest funding underscores the growing interest of China in the East African nation, which recently discovered huge commercial oil reserves and is on the verge of joining the ranks of other African oil-producing countries.Uganda has at least 5,000 troops under the African Union mandate in Somalia. In August, the Ugandan-led troops successfully flushed the al Shabab militants out of Somalia's port city of Mogadishu after nearly five years of fighting.However, fighting has continued on the outskirts of the city as well as in several areas of the countryside, and has since sucked in other countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia.The AU mission, which also includes Burundian troops, is mainly funded by the U.S. government.Chinese-owned enterprises hold lucrative oil deals in South Sudan, which neighbors Tanzania.

All Rights Reserved.JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) - Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi began a two-day visit to South Africa Monday, marking 10 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Yang paid a brief courtesy visit to President Thabo Mbeki before meeting with foreign affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma in Pretoria. It was the start of a tour of Africa, where China foreign ministry officials have traditionally started the year in a sign of the importance they place on the resource-rich continent.Yang was also to visit Congo, Burundi and Ethiopia.Yang said the China-South Africa relationship is 'of great importance,' the South African Press Association reported.Trade between South Africa, the continent's economic powerhouse and a major gold-producing country, and China reached US$240 million in the first 11 months of 2006, an increase of 34.5 percent from the previous year.Last year China's biggest bank, the state-owned Industrial   Commercial Bank of China Ltd. bought a 20 percent stake in South Africa's biggest lender, Standard Bank Group Ltd. in one of China's biggest foreign corporate acquisitions to date.Chinese investments into South Africa amount to US$130 million, mostly in a chromium mine while South African investments in China stand at about US$400 million including investments by Anglo American, SAB Miller and a US$120 million investment by a property group.Yang's visit comes a year after Chinese President Hu Jintao visited South Africa in early 2007.South Africa and China on Monday established a diplomatic mechanism to enhance political, economic and trade relations.Yang and Dlamini Zuma were also expected to discuss co-operation between the two countries in international affairs as well as Chinese support for peacekeeping operations in Africa.7Document APRS000020080107e41700378","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","South Africa","","0","Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), State-Owned Company","","Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), State-Owned Company","1","Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd., Private Sector","1","Raw","0","OOF-like","3","Unset","","Inactive","2","","","","","","","","","","","1","South Africa","560","218","South Africa","ZAF","ZA","710","199","Commercial","1","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"
"759","China","Not a project: Iron ore exploration","2011","false","China's third largest steelmaker—Wuhan Iron   Steel (WISCO)—is planning to start exploratory drilling for iron ore in the Madagascar Soalala region as soon as May 2011. WISCO Madagascar paid USD100 million for an exploration permit in 2010. 'Our investments are made in stages, depending on the results of the survey. The investment decision is expected in six to eight months, then will come the construction phase, which will last four years. The actual operation could start in five years,' said WISCO's chief executive Jun Yuan Lou.Significance: The operational environment in Madagascar presents some challenges, since the commencement of the political demise in March 2009 when incumbent President Andy Rajoelina seized power. In late December 2010, Madagascar Oil, a public company with the leading position in onshore exploration and development in Madagascar, announced the suspension of trading in its shares (see: Madagascar: 20 December 2010: ).The development comes after the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) less than two weeks earlier. The company's statement read: 'Following a meeting between the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons and Madagascar Oil in Antananarivo [the capital] late on 16 December, the ministry has indicated that it is interested in acquiring from the company all of its licences excluding Bemolanga. There can be no guarantee that any price agreed for such an acquisition will be representative of the fair value of such assets.' Situations such as these have increased the enforceability of contracts risk in Madagascar and could be an investment disincentive for companies and countries not willing to take up such perils in the future. Madagascar's vast mineral riches (oil, cobalt, nickel, gold and uranium) will, however, continue to lure those willing to take a high risk exposure, backed by high returns in the future.锦兴国际与武汉钢铁集团合作经营马达加斯加铁矿场锦兴国际宣布,与中国第三大钢铁生产企业武汉钢铁(集团)订立两份合作协议,当中订定有关于马达加斯加Bekisopa区(公司已收购该区面积约287平方公里之矿产勘探及开采权)及其它地区铁矿及其它矿产资源之勘探权及开采之合作条款。根据首份协议,双方将成立合营公司,锦兴占40%权益,锦兴将以其于Bekisopa区之勘探及开采权作为对合营公司之出资,双方各投入之投资金额及生产场地经营之详情有待公司进一步研究及调查后由双方进一步磋商。根据第二份合作协议,双方同意利用合营公司收购马达加斯加其它地区另一矿产勘探及开采权,倘合营公司取得所需之矿产勘探及开采权,策略伙伴须负责成立及经营生产场地,并已承诺按现行国际市场价购买所有开采出之金属资源。锦兴与策略伙伴已派专业人员及专家往Bekisopa区进行实地考察,并收集样本作测试之用,根据报告,所取得之样本含铁金属53.25%及钛金属11.42%。来源:汇港通讯中国武汉钢铁将勘探开采马达加斯加铁矿(本文由路透中文网编译提供)          路透塔那那利佛4月6日电---中国第三大钢铁厂商武汉钢铁公司(600005.SS: 行情)官员表示，公司计划从5月底开始，在马达加斯加的苏阿拉拉（Soalala）地区勘探开采铁矿石。          武钢去年向马达加斯加支付了1亿美元，获得该地区的勘探许可。许多外国企业都密切关注这个印度洋岛国的矿产资源。          武钢马达加斯加分公司负责人Jun Yuan Lou称：“我们的投资将根据勘探结果分阶段进行。预计将在6-8个月内做出投资决策，然後进入为期四年的建设阶段。”          他在周二晚的新闻发布会上说：“（矿山）五年後将进入实际运行阶段。”当天他与马达加斯加国家环境办公室签署了该矿的环境影响研究及勘探协议。          马达加斯加拥有石油、钴、镍、金、铀等矿藏。自拉乔利纳（Andry Rajoelina）于2009年3月就任总统以来，该国资源勘探业一直受政治危机拖累。（完）","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Madagascar","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020110408e7480000u&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

"860","China","Manganese mine- duplicate with 851","2011","false","Officials of the Indian mining concern Taurian Cote d’Ioire, which has been re-named Dharni Sampda, are all smiles these days. After some tough bargaining with mines and energy ministerAdama Toungara, the firm resumed work on May 9 at its manganese mine at Bondoukou in eastern Iory Coast. Africa Mining Intelligence understands that Toungara found no fault with a decree issued by former president Laurent Gbagbo last Dec. 4 that authorized Dharni Sampda to work the mine. At the outset of the crisis following December’s presidential election, the supporters of president Alassane Ouattara had blocked Dharni Sampda’s operations in the region.And on the crest of its recent backing from the new administration the company has begun talks on shortly starting work on a new manganese mine, at Odienne in north-west Iory Coast.The picture, however, is different for another manganese producer in the country, theCompagnie Miniere du Littoral (CML), which works the Lauzoua mine in the Grand Lahou region in the south. CML will have to wait until September before resuming work because the Grand Lahou region remains unstable, with Liberian mercenaries and pro-Gbagbo militia continuing to sow terror.CML is an Iory Coast-Chinese consortium composed of SODEMI (51%), the China National Geological   Mining Corporation (CGM, 39%), and the Iory Coast government (10%). With an annual capacity of 150,000 tons, CML had planned to double its output this year after launching a major investment program worth roughly CFA 10 billion.","Unset","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Cote D'Ivoire","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AMIN000020110603e75i00009&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

Platts. All Rights Reserved.Cape Town (Platts)--6Jul2009/456 pm EDT/2056 GMTGhana confirmed Monday that it wants to buy the stake that Texas-based Kosmos Energy is selling in the Jubilee offshore field.The Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, which has a 10% participating stake in the project, had written to Kosmos informing it of its interest, Deputy Oil Minister Kwabena Donkor said.Speaking on the sidelines of the opening of the CWC-organized Africa energy conference in Cape Town, Donkor also said that many companies including Shell, Eni, Total and Chevron were showing an interest in Kosmos' stake in the field.News first broke in February that Kosmos had appointed advisers to handle the sale of its interest in the two blocks that span the Jubilee field.Sources in Ghana also said that the China National Offshore Oil Corporation had offered $3 billion for the stake and that Shell had looked at the data, but had not made a bid.Government approval for the development plan for the Jubilee oil field was expected soon, Donkor said. Tullow Oil is the project's operator and is planning to invest about $3.1 billion along with its partners to start commercial crude production in the second half of 2010.The Jubilee oil field is reported to have around 1.2 billion barrels of oil, and is said to be the largest field to be discovered in West Africa in the last 10-15 years.Kosmos Energy is operator of the deepwater West Cape Three Points block in which part of the field is located, holding a 30.875% interest. Anadarko has a 30.875% stake, Tullow holds 22.896%, the E.O. Group 3.5%, and UK's Sabre Oil   Gas Holdings 1.854%.The rest of the Jubilee oil field is in the deepwater Tano block, operated by Tullow and where Kosmos holds an 18% interest as does Anadarko. Tullow holds 49.5% and Sabre 4.5%. GNPC has a 10% stake in both West Cape Three Points and Tano blocks.While some of the gas will be reinjected to maintain pressure in the reservoir, Donkor said Ghana was keen to harness gas from the field for power supply. The Jubilee field partners are reported to have reached a broad agreement with the government on a gas development plan that will include the capability for gas reinjection and a gas export pipeline to a processing plant on the coast. The Jubilee field discovery well, Mahogany-1, is located 63 kilometers from the Ghanaian coastline and 132 km southwest of the port city of Takoradi in the Tano Basin.0706200916245813869.xmlDocument PLATT00020090706e576001e2","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Petroleum Extraction","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Ghana","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=CERPDB0020090216e52g00006&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=

The debt was incurred when China built the Tanzania-Zambia railway to circumvent Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in the 1970s. The Tazara line enabled Zambia to export its copper through Dares-Salaam without going through the Rhodesia war zone. Hu says the debt cancellation is part of China's latest measures to increase economic and trade relations with Zambia, under its broader aid package to the country.

The dam was 185 meters tall and was developed and built by the state-owned Chinese National Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation (Sinohydro). It was also developed by Gezhouba Water and Power Group and Sur Construction Co. The dam was expected to produce 300 MW of electricity. Construction was expected to be completed in 2008, but did not finish until 2009.The dam financier is unclear. According to the World Bank, in 2002, the Export-Import Bank of China provided $50 million on concessional financing. However, a Taiwanese news source said that the China National Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation that built the dam financed it entirely.
