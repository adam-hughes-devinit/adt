''我们公司顺利完成了在南非博茨瓦纳的一个总承包项目，并且赢利可观。很难想象，这个项目前期规划并不完善，执政党出于下届选举需要，项目立项、决策阶段均比较仓促。建成时却赢得了业主、政府及社会各界的一致赞誉，这不能不说是个奇迹。管好分包有妙招——聘用外方协调人我们2003年1月与博茨瓦纳卫生部签订了马哈拉佩医院设计—施工总承包合同。合同总金额为4300万美元，合同工期为35个月；医院占地面积约15万平方米，总建筑面积49666平方米。马哈拉佩医院是一个大型综合性医院，涉及的专业非常广泛，指定分包的工作量占合同额的40%，在该项目中的主要指定专业分包有电气及医用器材分包、机械分包、电梯分包、发电机分包及锅炉分包等，承担这些分包工程的分包商均是综合型跨国公司，拥有丰富的国际工程管理经验，其技术力量雄厚。我公司作为马哈拉佩医院项目的总承包商，在统筹管理项目的同时，专门聘请了一名项目管理经验丰富的外籍员工担任该项目的协调人，协调各分包商的工作，监督工程质量和进度，同时还聘用了一名经验丰富的南非老估算师，负责项目的管理、对外交往及索赔工作。实践证明，上述人员在中方人员的指挥管理下，不仅解决了在语言交流上的困难，还增强了公司的对外实力。项目实施过程中，管理协调好各方之间的关系，对于全面实施合同、加快进度、提高工程质量起着举足轻重的作用。在马哈拉佩医院项目进行过程中，我们坚持每月召开两次总包与咨询工程师、总包与分包之间的协调会，会上主要解决每一阶段项目实施过程中存在的问题，处理项目信息，并协调有关各方的工作。现场材料供应——提前订货质优价廉材料管理工作是加快项目进度、降低项目成本的重要环节，材料供应又是保证项目能否顺利进行的关键。由于马哈拉佩医院项目设计所使用的大部分材料需要从南非、欧洲进口，而当地产品的生产种类和规模又有一定的局限性，因此提前订货就显得非常重要。加之该医院项目是浮动标，订货采购程序较为复杂。为了降低项目成本，我们在确保材料质量和供货周期的情况下，货比三家，选择质优、价实、供货周期短的供货商与其签订供货合同。在控制材料计划、材料质量、材料价格和供货周期这些材料管理工作关键程序的同时，明确材料人员的职责范围，制定出分阶段材料供货到场的计划安排，定期召开材料方面的协调会，确保生产所需材料、构件、设备等及时供应。抓紧索赔——FIDIC成护身符　　马哈拉佩医院项目在签订合同时是浮动标，因此索赔工作就显得尤为重要。尽管材料报价、购买、索赔工作程序繁琐，但它关系到整个项目的经济效益，所以我们将其作为工程索赔工作中的一项重要环节来抓。材料索赔是按照购买时的材料价与投标时的基价比较进行索赔的，因此在材料报价、购买、索赔时我们严格依据FIDIC条款和该项目估价师的要求，对该项目的所有材料在订货前向业主方估价师提供报价。　　该项目严格遵守FIDIC条款，条款对时间的要求很严格(承包商的索赔必须在28天内发出)，因此，各种索赔资料准备得是否及时、详细、有理有据是索赔能否成功的关键。由于我们吃透FIDIC条款，索赔工作进展得有序有效，公司获得了可观的经济效益。大胆本地化——迅速赢得市场　　在境外实施工程总承包项目，走属地化经营管理之路，是成功实施项目的关键，是扩大当地市场占有量的必由之路。属地化经营管理的实质就是要实行属地化策略，要在经营管理的各个层面按照项目所在国的规章、制度和运作方式规范操作流程。人才属地化是实现属地化管理的一项重要内容，要充分利用当地的人力资源，充分发挥他们在语言、文化、社会关系、沟通协调上的优势，甚至有些重要的项目管理岗位都可以大胆地起用当地人才。　　我公司1989年4月在博茨瓦纳注册，目前当地雇员已经超过1500人，分布在办事处总部、各项目经理部和施工现场各个层面。属地化经营使我们拿到了马哈拉佩医院的总承包项目，并通过该项目的成功实施，进一步提升了我公司在当地的知名度，使我公司在当地占领了一定的市场份额，成为当地主要承包商之一。　　我们公司在从国内选派有经验的优秀项目管理人员的同时，着手搞好当地劳动力资源的收集和管理，建立当地分包商及工人档案，从中选取以前合作过且表现较好的分包商，以及经验丰富、技术较熟练的工人。该项目提供给当地人才的工作岗位比较全面，包括项目管理人员、秘书、文员、估算师、工长、技术工种及普通劳力，该项目在实施高峰期中方人员约8 0人，当地工人超过1000人。'","Health","","","Implementation","2","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Botswana","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LQAF000020041210e0c80003v&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report; http://www.abbs.com.cn/jzsb/read.php?cate=5&recid=22703       , Local Language Source      , Donor media or official","2","","","","","","","Checked","1","ODA-like","2","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LQAF000020041210e0c80003v&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report; http://www.abbs.com.cn/jzsb/read.php?cate=5&recid=22703         , Factiva        , Donor media or official","","","","","","","","","","1","Botswana","571","227","Botswana","BWA","BW","72","616","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

Rwanda will receive half the amount as a grant and the remaining 50 million yuan as a five-year interest free loan, said Gao Hucheng, Chinese Deputy Commerce Minister and international trade representative.Chinese firms are increasingly making strategic entries into Kigali, targeting mainly infrastructure projects. China will send an expert group to Rwanda for a feasibility study of a 25km road construction project in the capital city of Kigali, financed by the Chinese government. Chinese engineers are also expected to construct a new ultra-modern clinic in Masaka, a suburb of Kigali.Kigali for its part is sending a delegation to China, led by Prime Minister Bernard Makuza as it seeks to attract investment from the world's second largest economy.'We are beginning to see requests from China after a visit last year. We have another trip planned for November and this is to try to attract more Chinese investors into Rwanda,' John Gara, the chief executive officer of the Rwanda Development Board, the institution charged with promoting investment in the country, told The EastAfrican last week. 'China is also one of the few countries where RDB has an office (in Shenzhen) and it has proved useful,' he saidA July 2011 International Monetary Fund report on Rwanda shows foreign direct investments decline from $118.7 million in 2009 to $42.3 million last year.RDB is targeting at least $500 million in new investments both local and foreign in 2011. 'In the past, we have been promoting Rwanda in a more general way, but now, we are not only targeting certain companies, but also targeting projects,' Mr Gara said.While Asian investment is steadily rising in the country with the RDB registering 20 companies from the region within a period of six months this year with an estimated value of $16.5 million, Chinese investment is still relatively low compared with India. Between January and July this year, Indian investments were estimated at $9.2 million, mainly in agro-processing, manufacturing and administrative and support service sectors, while Chinese projects amounted to $5 million, mainly in tourism, construction and manufacturing sectors.'The figures for Chinese FDI are not yet as high as we would want them to be, but certainly we are beginning to see interest,' Mr Gara observed.Chinese ambassador to Rwanda Shu Zhan said while the country has registered tremendous progress in improving its business environment, including setting up a One-Stop Centre for registration, the 'paperwork' is just one aspect of the whole investment environment needed to attract investment.'The regional situation, especially the uncertain stability of the Great Lakes Region, also affects on the confidence of investors. Rwanda still has room to improve the investment environment, for example, by offering tax breaks,' he said.Trade between the two countries doubled to $76.4 million in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year.'There are various areas of interest such as telecoms, mining and engineering. More than 100 such entrepreneurs have already visited Rwanda to get a better understanding of the environment,' he said.According to Standard Bank Group Ltd, Chinese investment in Africa may grow by 70 per cent to $570 billion by 2015 from 2009, while blateral trade will double to $300 billion by 2015. Chinese firms, led by state-owned China National Offshore Company (CNOOC) are some of the major players in the oil exploration business in East Africa.

"1979","China","Rwandatel, Huawei in $35m Deal (Not a Project)","2008","false","19 February 2008 03:15 AMAll Africa AFNWS English (c) 2008 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Kigali, Feb 19, 2008 (East African Business Week/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Rwandatel, a landline telephony and Internet Service Provider has signed a US$35million deal with Huawei Technologies based in China to expand network in Rwanda. According to a press release from Rwandatel the deal signed last week in Kigali will facilitate a nationwide rollout of new infrastructure that will support Rwandatel's Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) and 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System(UMTS) network services. Rwandatel's partnership agreement with Huawei Technologies, a private high-tech enterprise and a global leader in providing next generation telecommunications networks, based in Shenzhen city, South China, seeks to help Rwandatel revamp its landline network and replace its Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) with a New Generation Network (NGN) to attain a strong network. The deal is expected to accelerate Rwandatel's GSM to cover most of the inhabited areas and roads with the 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) covering most of the urban centres in Rwanda. Huawei Technologies is the largest telecom vendor in China's telecom market and have already won trust from over 300 telecom carriers around the world. Its products and solutions serve over 90 countries, as well as 22 of the world's top 50 operators. In 2004, its contracted sales reached US$5.58 billion, an increase of 45% year on year. In the same year, the company's international sales hit $2.28billion. Huawei Technologies now operates worldwide with 55 branch offices in nine regions worldwide. It has set up several research institutes in Dallas and Silicon Networks Valley in USA, Bangalore in India, and Stockholm in Sweden, Moscow in Russia as well as Beijing and Shanghai in China. The signing of this deal comes two months after the acquisition of Rwandatel by LAP Green Networks, a subsidiary of the Libyan African Portfolio (LAP), an arm of the Libyan Government. LAP Green Networks specializes in acquiring and managing networks across Africa and is currently present in over five countries and expanding. LAP Green Networks now owns 80% shares in Rwandatel while the remaining 20% stake belongs to Social Security Fund of Rwanda (SSFR). LAP Green acquired 80% stake in Rwandatel by paying $100illion and promised to invest other $300m in fifteen years in the national telecommunication set up. During the signing agreement, LAP Green pledged to spend $87m in its first year of operations in Rwanda. Rwandatel, a formerly state owned telecom company that was founded in 1993, had in 2005 been privatised to Terracom Communications, an American IT provider on the cost of $20million equivalent to 99% stake. Terracom Communications was owned by Mr. Greg Wyler. The deal went sour with government accusing Terracon of failing to deliver its commitments. The government of Rwanda later in 2007 bought back Rwandatel from Terracom Communications and sold it to LapGreen Networks to revamp the sector. 'The contract between Rwandatel and Huawei is only the first amongst many to come,' the release reads in part, adding that in the following weeks, Rwandatel, will be signing contracts worth over $40million.

China has been offering low interest loans, debt relief and other incentives to increase its influence on the world's poorest continent in return for access to the natural resources it needs to feed its booming economy. 'China and Africa have developed mutually respectful and beneficial relations over the years,' Hu said at a banquet thrown by President Paul Biya of Cameroon, in a speech broadcast on state television and radio. 'China and Africa have never tried to impose their social and economic development models on others,' Hu added. Hu, who also toured Africa last year, met Biya to discuss social aid programs for clean drinking water and cheap housing, as well as a greater role for China in the local oil industry and other resource sectors.'Through you, I invite Chinese companies to come and invest in Cameroon, especially in hydrocarbons such as gas and oil, mineral exploitation and forestry, where numerous opportunities exist,' Biya said at a working session with Hu.Hu, the first Chinese head of state to visit Cameroon, was greeted by singing, dancing and flag-waving children. Citing the World Bank, Biya told Hu that since receiving debt relief under the so-called Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, Cameroon had become 'one of the best risks in Africa.'Hu arrived in Cameroon late Tuesday on the first leg of an eight- country tour that will also take him to Liberia, Sudan, Namibia, South Africa, Seychelles, Zambia and Mozambique.Hu and his group, which includes the minister of commerce, Bo Xilai, the foreign minister Li Zhaoxing and other senior policy makers, signed eight accords with Cameroon. Those deals included a 40 million yuan, or $5.15 million, grant and 30 million yuan interest-free loan for economic and technical cooperation, as well as two concessionary loans of 350 million yuan each, one for telecommunications projects. Hu also canceled Cameroon's debt to China - whose value was not specified - and signed agreements to build two schools and a hospital in Cameroon's commercial capital, Douala.China's trade with Cameroon, which has reserves of oil, bauxite and iron ore, doubled to $338 million in the first 11 months of 2006.At a special China-Africa summit in Beijing in November, Hu offered $5 billion in loans and credit to Africa and pledged to double aid, keen to demonstrate that China's ties with Africa went beyond thirst for its oil and raw materials.Trade between China and Africa jumped 40 percent to $55.5 billion in 2006, with the balance of trade $2.1 billion in Africa's favor, according to Chinese Trade Ministry data published this week by Xinhua, the official press agency.'Many African nations cannot look to the U.S. or Europe as models for development because they are simply too advanced,' said Hu Biliang, a senior economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government research group based in Beijing. 'China is a developing nation and ideologically similar,' the economist added. 'Oil and energy trade offer China and Africa a mutual opportunity to gain through trade, but more importantly China offers many African states an example of development, a road to follow.'But some Africans have warned that poor African countries may ultimately lose from expanding trade with China unless they carefully examine bilateral deals and protect their weak manufacturing sectors from inexpensive Chinese clothes and household goods. This means Hu may face a more guarded reception than in the past.Some Western leaders and analysts have criticized China for offering trade, aid and investment with no strings attached, saying it undermines efforts by Western donors to promote democracy and human rights through conditional aid.Hu's trip will also take him to Sudan, where civil war in the Darfur region has killed an estimated 200,000 people and forced 2.5 million more from their homes in violence that Washington has labeled as genocide. China has resisted sanctions and other pressure on Sudan, from which it buys crude oil, saying they will not help to solve the conflict in Darfur. But it said Wednesday that it would support a joint UN-African Union peacekeeping mission to Darfur.Document INHT000020070201e32100023''　据喀麦隆《论坛报》30日报道，喀麦隆政府将拨款240亿非洲法郎（约合5200万美元），帮助西北省“杀人湖”尼奥斯湖移民安居乐业和进一步治理“杀人湖”。　　该报援引喀麦隆西北省省长库帕·伊萨的讲话称，这笔资金将主要用于建设尼奥斯湖的毒气检测和排放系统以及移民迁入地区的水电供应系统和医疗卫生设施。　　伊萨说，喀麦隆政府“决定投入240亿非洲法郎，其中80亿非洲法郎已到位”。　　1986年8月21日夜，超量的二氧化碳气体突然从尼奥斯湖中喷出，掀起80多米高的水浪。随着闷雷般的轰响声，这股强大的气体在湖区周围迅速扩散和蔓延，仅半小时就使沿湖1746名居民和6000多头牲畜窒息死亡。　　尼奥斯湖为火山湖，海拔1091米，长2500米，宽1500米，平均水深200米，湖中存积着巨量二氧化碳和二氧化硫等有害气体，如遇地震或地层变化，便可能发生剧烈的喷发或爆炸。距离该湖不远的莫努恩湖于1984年8月15日也曾喷发过毒气，夺去数百人的生命。（记者陆遥）''新华网雅温得1月31日电（记者 钱彤 陆遥） 正在对喀麦隆进行国事访问的国家主席胡锦涛1月31日在雅温得同喀麦隆总统比亚举行会谈。双方就中喀关系、中非关系和其他共同关心的重大问题交换了意见，达成重要共识，一致同意共同努力，推动中喀友好合作关系和中非新型战略伙伴关系深入发展。    胡锦涛表示，建交36年来，中喀两国人民的传统友谊不断加深，两国友好合作关系稳定健康发展，取得了丰硕的成果。政治交往和合作有力地增强了双方政治互信，成为中喀友好合作关系的基础；多种形式的经贸合作不断深化，成为双方加强合作的优先领域；社会人文合作增进了两国人民的相互了解和友谊，成为双方深化合作的重要方面。喀麦隆政府坚定奉行一个中国政策，在台湾、人权等问题上给予中方宝贵支持，中方对此深表赞赏。    胡锦涛指出，实践证明，中喀友好合作关系有力促进了双方发展进步，符合两国和两国人民的根本利益。胡锦涛结合落实中非合作论坛北京峰会成果，就发展中喀关系提出建议：一、增强政治互信和合作，加强各层次往来和交流，在涉及各自利益的重大问题上继续相互支持和帮助。二、拓展互利双赢的经贸合作，确保在建合作项目按期保质完成，发挥经济互补优势，重点加强农业、初级产品加工、基础设施、能源、电信等领域的互利合作。三、密切社会人文领域的交流合作，加强教育、卫生、文化、体育、旅游等社会人文领域的交流，鼓励两国妇女、青年组织扩大交往。四、加强多边领域的协调和配合，在重大国际和地区问题上保持沟通和协调，维护发展中国家正当权益，共同推动建设持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐世界。 ''中国援建喀麦隆吉德和楠加-埃博科两所小学校交接证书由中国驻喀麦隆大使黄长庆与喀基础教育部部长尤素福？阿蒂加？阿丽姆（YOUSSOUF Née HADIDJA ALIM）分别代表中喀双方于2009年12月23日在雅温得签署。　　两所小学校是根据2007年1月31日中国与喀麦隆政府换文规定，分别由沈阳国际经济技术合作公司和重庆国际经济技术合作公司承建的项目，先后在2009年内通过双方验收，具备了交付条件。 ' ","Education","","110","Pipeline/identification","1","Unset","Cameroon","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070131e31v00148&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report; http://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/20091225/02037153091.shtml       , Local Language Source      , Donor media or official","2","","China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Corporation (CSYIC), State-Owned Company","China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Corporation (CSYIC), State-Owned Company; China Chongqing International Construction Corporation (CICO), State-Owned Company","2","","","Raw","0","ODA-like","2","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070131e31v00148&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report; http://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/20091225/02037153091.shtml         , Factiva        , Donor media or official","","","","","","","","25 December 2009","","1","Cameroon","471","229","Cameroon","CMR","CM","120","622","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

"448","China","Preferential Loan Agreement (Duplicate)","2008","false","'KINSHASA, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi Tuesday made a one-day visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) aimed at enhancing mutual understanding and expanding cooperation. He held talks with President Joseph Kabila who hailed China for providing valuable support and aid to his country at a critical time of peace and reconstruction, which demonstrated the genuine friendship between the two countries and their people. The DRC is located in central Africa, with an area of 2,345,410 square km. As of July 2005, it has a population of around 60 million. Years of war dramatically reduced national output and government revenue. Conditions improved in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. Since August last year, government forces have been battling rebels in provinces of North and South Kivu. In talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao in March 2005, visiting DRC President Kabila called China a dependable friend of the DRC. China officially recognized the Congolese government shortly after it declared independence from Belgium on June 30, 1960. In February, 1961, China and the then Republic of Congo established diplomatic relations. Since No. 19, 1972 when the two countries issued a joint communique on bilateral relations, China and the DRC have maintained exchanges of high-level visits. In November 2006, along with other African countries, the DRC signed a declaration on the establishment of a new strategic partnership between China and Africa during Beijing Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. The DRC was the second leg of Yang's four-nation tour to Africa, which includes the other three countries of South Africa, Burundi and Ethiopia. The visiting Chinese foreign minister said that 'China and the DRC are good friends and good partners. The two countries have been constantly supporting each other on the basis of mutual understandings in issues related with national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Kabila reiterated his government's adherence to the one-China policy, saying the DRC government attaches great importance to its relations with China. The DRC and China share common views on many issues of significance, and the potential for bilateral cooperation is huge, Kabila said, expressing his willingness to ensure a smooth bilateral cooperation in fields like trade and investment. The Chinese minister said China appreciates the DRC government's adherence to the one-China policy, and firmly supports the DRC's efforts in consolidating peace, promoting national reconciliation and realizing economic development. He said that China would further strengthen bilateral cooperation in fields like economics and trade, and implement related cooperation projects, in order to benefit the Congolese people and push the bilateral relations to a new high. Yang also held talks with his DRC counterpart Antipas Mbusa Nyamwisi, state minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, during which the two sides hailed the bilateral relations, agreed to promote mutual understanding and friendship, and enhance political dialogue, under the framework of which the two countries can exchanges views on bilateral, regional and international issues. Nyamwisi also briefed the Chinese FM on the security situation in eastern DRC and on the progress of the on-going conference on peace, security and development in eastern provinces of North and South Kivu. They also signed a preferential loan agreement worth 33.6 million U.S. dollars, to be financed by the Export-Import Bank of China, for the construction of a national fiber optic trunk in the DRC. The project will be undertaken by China International Telecommunication Construction Corporation. The two ministers consented to further implement the assistance measures announced at Beijing Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in November last year, and expand cooperation in fields like trade, infrastructure construction, culture, education, health and human resources. Trade between the two countries in the January-November period last year grew by 26.8 percent over the same period of the previous year, totaling 490 million U.S. dollars, according to statistics from China's Ministry of Commerce.

He said Egypt is working to secure as much as $2 billion in Chinese investment as it seeks to take advantage of China's expanding interests in the resource-rich region.As part of China's drive in the Middle East and Africa, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Egypt in June. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is scheduled to come to Beijing in November. An economic and trade relationship that is expanding quickly -- albeit from a small base -- is expected to top his agenda.Mr. Rachid said Egypt's total trade with China is likely to reach $5 billion by 2010, from just more than $1 billion in 2005. 'It's nothing to do with politics. It's only because China is able to offer cheaper and better products than everybody else,' he said. Mr. Rachid dismissed the possibility that stronger trade ties with China would affect the U.S.'s influence in the region. The U.S. provides Egypt, a critical Mideast ally, with billions of dollars in military and other aid. 'The U.S. will, of course, continue to be a very important strategic and economic partner with Egypt,' he said. 'It's not either-or.'Skeptics in the U.S. worry that China's growing stake in the region could lead Beijing into conflict with Washington's agenda. Already, China has opposed U.S. plans to bring United Nations' peacekeepers to war-torn Sudan, one of the top sources of China's oil, and Beijing is resisting calls for stronger sanctions against Iran, another major supplier of energy.China now dominates the trade relationship with Egypt, having sold $915 million in goods to Egypt in 2005. Mr. Rachid says the gap is likely to persist. Thus, he is trying to bring some balance to the broader economic relationship by bringing in Chinese investment, promoting Egypt's proximity to markets in southern Europe and Africa and its network of free-trade agreements.Deals agreed upon during Mr. Rachid's trip include a $500 million convention center to be built by a Chinese construction company outside Cairo and the building of a $120 million cement factory that will use Chinese technology. Another plan under discussion with Chinese conglomerate Citic Group is the building of a $100 million aluminum plant in Egypt.Mr. Rachid said Egypt also has created a dedicated industrial park, called the Suez Economic Zone, that will be run by a Chinese company and will specialize in attracting other Chinese corporations to invest.Document WSJE000020060907e29700009'","Manufacturing and Industry","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Egypt","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WSJE000020060907e29700009&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=MENATW0020070924e36t0000a&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DAINEG0020081204e4c400031&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , Recipient media or official","3","","Tianjin Cement Industry Design & Research Institute Co., Ltd.

He placed special emphasis on the importance the relationship held for Egypt’s job market, as well as technology exchanges.Taha expects the countries to work together on exploring and refinery projects, as well as oil rig manufacturing.Egypt’s first oil rig, Mubarak-1, was built earlier this year by an Egyptian-Chinese factor.In July 2005, the Tharwa Petroleum of Egypt and China’s Sinopec created Sinotharwa Drilling Company, an $18 million joint venture providing oil and gas drilling in Egypt and other parts of Africa and the Middle East.Additionally, the two countries have cooperated on Egyptian Petroleum HH Rig Manufacturing Shareholder Company.Earlier last week, Reuters reported that Zhiming Zhao, executive president of Sinopec, said China intends to increase its oil and gas imports from Africa by 10% in the next five to 10 years. Egypt, Equitorial Guinea, the Sudan, and Nigeria were specifically mentioned by Zhao as countries China wanted to continue to work with in importing oil.Currently, China imports roughly 30% of its total oil imports from Africa and has invested approximately $30 billion in the continent’s oil and gas infrastructure. – Frank NietoDocument HFTM000020080417e43o0002w'","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","Joint venture with recipient","Egypt","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=HFTM000020080417e43o0002w&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report","1","","","","","","","Checked","1","OOF-like","3","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=HFTM000020080417e43o0002w&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report","","","","","","","","","","1","Egypt","651","142","Egypt","EGY","EG","818","469","Commercial","1","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

"729","China","Upgrade of telephone system (Duplicate) ","2006","false","ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP)--Three Chinese firms will invest $1.5 billion over the next four years to upgrade Ethiopia's telephone system, officials said Thursday. Huawei Technologies Co., China International Telecommunication Construction Corp. and ZTE Corp., plan to expand the network as part of one of the largest financial investments ever made in the impoverished Horn of Africa nation, officials said. The companies were from among eight international bidders, among them Ericsson, Nokia and Siemens. The firms aim to boost mobile phone users from the current 1.5 million customers to 7 million. Fixed lines will be quadrupled from 1 million to 4 million users. The project represents a huge investment in Ethiopia where annual incomes are just $100 and annual gross domestic product just $8 billion. The country frequently suffers severe food shortages and is unable to feed its 77 million people without foreign aid. 'It should be a significant improvement in our country's telecom system,' said Abdurahim Ahmed, spokesman of the Ethiopian Ministry of Telecommunications. 'It will even deliver services to very remote areas and expanding on already existing services in the urban centers, along with improvements in the mobile network system.' The Ethiopian government was seeking others to invest an extra $900 million needed to completely overhaul the telecommunications infrastructure, he said. Chinese officials weren't immediately available for comment. China is eager to expand relations with Africa, offering aid, trade and investment deals to gain access to markets and oil supplies. Bilateral trade between China and Africa has more than tripled since 2000 and now exceeds $40 billion a year.

"746","China","DUPLICATE","2007","false","'Copyright 2007, Global Insight Limited. All Rights Reserved.China's Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing is currently on a seven-country tour of sub-Saharan Africa, visiting states that his country could profit from by exploiting minerals or securing future energy supplies. Li, having finished his visit to Equatorial Guinea, met Chad's president Idriss Déby Itno, with whom he discussed security issues and the conflict in Sudan’s Darfur region. Li later signed off on a loan of US$26 million and promised to cancel debts that Chad owed to China. The African country is looking for significant investment in its hydrocarbons sector and in August 2006 decided diplomatically to recognise China over Taiwan (see Chad: 9 August 2006:). Significance: China is responsible for building up Sudan's oil industry from a low level and after this first visit by a senior government minister from the East Asian giant, Chad can also expect huge investment in its oil sector.Because of China's special relationship with Sudan, hostilities between Chad and Sudan should cease permanently. Chad's oil is currently exported by pipeline via Cameroon, but with Chinese funds it is possible that a new pipeline will be constructed and Chad's crude could be exported from Sudan's east coat. Meanwhile, Li's visit to Equatorial Guinea saw his host's bilateral debt to China reduced by US$75 million. Global Insight believes China will take significant acreage in Equatorial Guinea's upcoming licensing round due early this year; the country's oil sector is currently dominated by U.S. firms. When Li completes his seven nation tour he will also have visited Guinea Bissau, Botswana, Eritrea, Central African Republic and Benin. ''中国外长李肇星已抵达乍得并与乍得总统伊特诺举行了会晤。双方就乍得邻国苏丹受战乱摧残的达尔富尔地区的人道主义危机等事项进行了磋商。这是李肇星此次非洲七国访问的第四站。李肇星此行的主要目的是加深中国与非洲各国的关系，同时李肇星此行也反映出中国对非洲大陆日益增加的经济兴趣。李肇星还签署了一系列协议，包括中国向乍得提供价值两千六百万美元的优惠贷款及免除乍得欠中国的数十亿美元债务等内容。此前，李肇星刚刚结束对中西非国家几内亚比绍的访问，几内亚比绍获得了中国四百万美元的捐助。中国迫切希望打通渠道获得非洲大陆丰富的石油与矿产资源，用来满足国内经济高速发展的需要。因此中国和苏丹与津巴布韦等因侵犯人权而遭到西方国家摈弃的非洲国家发展关系的做法也饱受西方国家的批评。' ","Debt Relief","","600","Pipeline/identification","1","Debt forgiveness","Chad","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020070105e31500019&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report; http://www.1688.com.au/news/200701/hotnet5090.shtml       , Local Language Source      , Donor media or official","2","","","","","","","Raw","0","ODA-like","2","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020070105e31500019&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report; http://www.1688.com.au/news/200701/hotnet5090.shtml         , Factiva        , Donor media or official","1000000000.0","USD","0.8379948373178","1.0","1193324774.17","","","","","1","Chad","483","232","Chad","TCD","TD","148","628","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"
"757","China","Not a project: Revival of tram project NEEDS CONFIRMATION","2011","false","In 2011, a media source reported that the China International Fund Ltd was planning to revive the tram project in Antananarivo.Chinese companies have gone on the offensive in Madagascar, where the Minister for Finance, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, has just informed the President for Transition, Andry Rajoelina known as TGV, about the project to create the Madagascar Development Corporation (MDC), a joint venture between the Malagasy State (15%) and the China International Fund Ltd (CIF). A company based in Hong Kong and related to China Sonangol (an alliance between Chinese capital and the Angolan State), CIF is particularly planning to revie the tram project in Antananarivo (ION 1297). The financial configuration of this future MDC is similar to that of the Société Sino-Guinéennede Déeloppement which the CIF tried to found in Conakry (Guinea) at the end of 2009 when the country was under the thumb of President Moussa Dadis Camara. The sponsors of this Guinean company are the very same that are now trying to promote Sino-Angolan interests to TGV: the former Guinean Minister for Mines, Mahmoud Thiam, a close friend of his Malagasy opposite number, Mamy Ratovomalala, and the International Football Federation (FIFA) player agent Amadou Diaby. These two men went to Antananarivo several times, where they were received by TGV and his advisors. According to Africa Energy Intelligence (sister publication to The Indian Ocean Newsletter), China-Sonangol is planning, via their intermediary, to recover the oil search permits that the Malagasy State is trying to revoke from Madagascar Oil.Thiam and Diaby also took a Frenchman along with them: Gilles Wertheimer, a businessman who may already have participated in building a military hospital in Guinea with Chinese funding. Via his company Alliance International Partners, whose Africa representative is Diaby, Wertheimer offered TGV to build several pre-fabricated hospitals, thereby enabling him to keep promises he had made during the campaign for the constitutional referendum last year. Wertheimer estimates that this construction work could be financed by levying $10 million on the amount paid by the Chinese company Wisco to obtain its contract to work iron ore at Soalala.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Madagascar","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=IOLET00020110204e71m0000s&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report","1","China International Fund (CIF), Private Sector","","China International Fund (CIF), Private Sector","1","","","Checked","1","OOF-like","3","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=IOLET00020110204e71m0000s&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report","","","","","","","","","","1","Madagascar","580","252","Madagascar","MDG","MG","450","674","Commercial","1","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

A meeting scheduled next week in Geneva with all its main donors will be a make-or-break moment for the country - its chance to secure reliable funding to underpin an overdue economic recovery.The meeting has repeatedly been put back because of domestic political events. The last time a Guinea-Bissau government managed to obtain a package of donor pledges was in 1999, in the aftermath of destructive civil conflict. An agreement was then made with the International Monetary Fund, but it fell through in 2001 because of slippages in the government's engagements.An emergency post-conflict deal was expected at the end of last year. But then came another setback - the unexpected decision by newly-elected President Joao Bernardo 'Nino' Vieira to sack the government. The donors' meeting was postponed once more.Guinea-Bissau, one of a dozen countries in the world that have stayed in the World Bank's category of fragile states for the last four years, is back to the same point it was at just over a year ago. The International Monetary Fund is ready to give the go-ahead for its special post-conflict assistance. This will be a signal for other aid, starting with $10m of budget support which the government has already negotiated with the World Bank.Oer the past few years, European and regional partners have had to come to the rescue with exceptional one-off help to meet essential needs such as paying wage bills and purchasing fuel. Guinea-Bissau has not always been able to make use of assistance available, especially when aid agencies or non-governmental organisations require matching local funds for their projects.In irregular fashion, the country has been receiving about $50m a year from multilateral and bilateral sources. It is now looking at least to double this flow.The government's poverty reduction strategy sets out financing needs over the next three years of $441m, covering mainly capital spending programmes. Just under 20 per cent is already accounted for, leaving a funding gap of $354m. This is without counting the cost of reforming the armed forces and police, which will also require donor money.International officials expect there to be broad support for the programme at the Geneva meeting, but the level of new funding remains uncertain. The government, they say, has set its financial targets high, and some parts of the programme may run beyond the three-year time frame.Prospects for a sharp increase in backing are pegged to the government's blueprint for military reform, which is designed to renew donors' confidence about the political outlook, and the economic policy framework presented in the latest annual budget.'We are fairly confident that the international community is sensitive to our programme,' says Issufo Sanha, economy minister.If the meeting is a success, it will be seen as a significant step towards normalisation.Oer the years, the country has suffered from donor fatigue as former supporters became disenchanted. The government is hoping to recover their backing, especially for the security sector. Among the main donors, the World Bank has projects devoted to HIV/Aids and other health issues, a broad infrastructure programme and rehabilitation of the private sector. The African Development Bank has stepped up its involvement with projects of $8m each in agriculture and new mooring facilities for fishing boats.The European Commission has concentrated mainly on infrastructure, with the emphasis moving from roads to energy. France and Portugal are the only EU countries with embassies in Bissau, the former focusing on health and governance and the latter also involved in education and capacity-building. As part of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, Brazil is also playing an increasing role.Alongside this aid, Guinea-Bissau has been receiving significant assistance from China, following a breach in relations between 1990 and 1998, when the country dealt with Taiwan instead. The Chinese have big interests in fishing and are seen as potential partners for oil. Aid projects have included the renovation and staffing of a hospital at Canchungo in the north-west. In the capital, a prominent new parliament building, completed last year, stands as a conspicuous symbol of China's support. Ministers say the Chinese are now also helping to provide military housing and are due to deliver new government offices.At a time when western partners are seeking a co-ordinated approach and exerting pressure for more rigorous economic management, the country's arrangements with China are the subject of some speculation.President Joao Bernardo Vieira says the government sees relations with China as complementary to western donors, arguing that 'countries such as China and Brazil have technologies adapted to our level of development'.

Iory Coast is open to all investors to exploit the riches of our mineral reserves,' said Minister of Mines and Energy Leon Monnet.Trade with China has more than doubled, from 50 billion CFA francs, or $112.6 million, to 112 billion CFA francs in 2008.Chinese companies are particularly active in transport and construction, with various building projects including a new presidential palace in the capital Yamoussoukro and a new hospital in President Laurent Gbagbo's hometown, Gagnoa.The other main manganese mine is in the northeast at Bondoukou and run by the Indian firm Taurian.So far this year, Iory Coast has exported 74,822 metric tons of manganese ore, down 32,176 tons, or 30%, from the 106,998 tons shipped up to this point last year, according to official port data.Iory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer, but the minerals and hydrocarbons sector is increasingly important.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Joint venture with recipient","Cote D'Ivoire","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJCS000020090923e59n000ac&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report","1","","","China National Geological & Mining Corporation (CGM), State-Owned Company","1","Societe pour le Developpement Minier de la Cote d'Ivoire (SODEMI), State-Owned Company","1","Raw","0","Vague (Official Finance)","5","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJCS000020090923e59n000ac&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report","","","","","","","","","","1","Cote D'Ivoire","437","247","Cote D'Ivoire","CIV","CI","384","662","Commercial","1","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

Lila Ratsifandriamanana, minister of foreign affairs of Madagascar, said for years China has helped the African nation with projects involving sugar, medicare, agriculture and housing.She also said Madagascar and other African countries are grateful for China's move to cut their foreign debt. Sama Siama Banya, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation in Sierra Leone, said his country has been servicing external debt at the cost of developing the economy.After wars and conflicts, he said, Sierra Leone urgently needs capital for economic recovery, and is delighted at China's debt-relief endeavour.China established diplomatic ties with Sierra Leone in 1971. Since then, Banya said, China has never imposed its will on Sierra Leone.Bonaya Godana, Kenyan minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, said external debt has been a heavy burden on Africa. Many countries spend 30 per cent of their revenue repaying debt, thus affecting the development of education, medicare and social welfare.He said Kenya hopes the international community, especially developed countries, make more commitments to alleviating the debt of Africa.Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, minister of state for foreign relations of Cameroon, said slave trade and colonialism has put Africa in a disadvantageous position. He noted that the average yearly income of people in sub-Saharan countries is only 500 US dollars per capita.With rising debt, trade deficit and decrease of international assistance, African countries risk being marginalized during the course of economic globalization, he said.He said China has been providing huge aid to African countries, and Africa sincerely thanks China for doing this. Andre Bumaya, minister of foreign affairs of Rwanda, said China has always sided with African countries regardless of changes in international politics.Bumaya said Rwanda is thankful to China, and that the forum has injected new vitality into China-Africa relations.

Analysts expect it to reach $30 billion by 2006. >>China currently has 84 companies operating in Madagascar, according to government statistics. >>Chinese companies control over two-thirds of the tax-free textiles export business, the island's biggest foreign exchange earner, and also are players in Madagascar's road construction programme. >>France and the United States are Madagascar's two largest trading partners. >>Huang said Chinese investment in Madagascar was currently running at $40 million, but would probably increase. >>The Chinese government would continue to donate development aid, beyond existing projects in road construction, and the building of sugar and pharmaceutical factories and a sports stadium, he added. >>Last month, Hong Kong tycoon Hui Chi Ming's Gahood Holdings bought the bankrupt Malagasy Banking Company and revied it with new capital as the International bank of China-Madagascar. >>Madagascar is negotiating an offshore oil exploration concession with China's National Petroleum Corporation.

'This shows that more and more countries attach importance to the Protocol, which is the first international legal instrument to address this issue of humanitarian concern. Now, almost all major land mine producing and using countries have acceded to the protocol.'However, Sha said, 58 states are too few. 'Lack of universality will undercut the protocol's significance,' he stressed. 'And no matter how perfect an international legal instrument is, its influence and effectiveness will be limited in the absence of universal participation.'He urged the states to follow the Protocol in earnest.Sha announced that the Chinese delegation is strongly opposed to any proposal for further amending the protocol at the current stage.However, he said, states may, on a voluntary basis, take the lead in implementing technical specifications as outlined in the proposed amendments and provide gratuitous technical assistance, equipment and training to developing countries.On humanitarian de-mining, Sha said that the Chinese government is continuing to cooperate with the Mine Action Service of the United Nations Department of Peace-Keeping Operations by co-sponsoring another training workshop on de-mining technology from May to June this year, with trainees from Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Rwanda.The Chinese government is pressing rapidly ahead with its donations of de-mining equipment to Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Namibia, he added.'We hope this conference will strengthen exchanges and cooperation on de-mining technologies for reducing and ultimately doing away with land mines Sha said.He emphasized that the Chinese government stands ready to cooperate and exchange with interested countries and inter-organizations in the field of humanitarian de-mining assistance and that China is also willing to join other states and explore ways to streamline the de-mining process.Document xnews00020010818dwcc01d3t","Humanitarian and Disaster Relief and Preparation","","","Completion","3","Scholarships/training in the donor country","Africa, regional, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda","http://global.factiva.http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=xnews00020010818dwcc01d3t&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , Donor media or official","1","","","","","","","Raw","0","Vague (Official Finance)","5","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=xnews00020010818dwcc01d3t&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , Donor media or official","","","","","","","","","","7","Africa, regional","541; 565; 531; 517; ; 540; 530","259; 275; 271; 266; 298; 225; 238","Mozambique; Namibia; Eritrea; Rwanda; Africa, regional; Angola; Ethiopia","MOZ; NAM; ERI; RWA; ; AGO; ETH","MZ; NA; ER; RW; XR; AO; ET","508; 516; 232; 646; ; 24; 231","688; 728; 643; 714; ; 614; 644","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

He said Xianyi has been a mover in development due to his devotion and willingness to succeed, adding his absence would be felt by majority of the citizens as his presence made a great difference.Ambassador Xianyi said Lesotho has great potential for development, not only on its natural resources being the clean abundant water, beautiful climate and scenery, but also in Lesotho citizens who are the greatest assets that Lesotho possesses.He indicated that Basotho would treasure the stable political situation and make joint efforts to create a bright future. He mentioned that last year when famine hit in Lesotho, the Chinese government extended their hands to assist, adding that when China was stricken by natural disasters, the Chinese people always received quick consolation and sympathy from Lesotho.However, he noted that since the Prime Minister's visit to China, the cooperation between the two countries has stepped into fast track in various fields like education, health, culture, industry, environment, and military training.He mentioned that about 30 Lesotho citizens are being trained in China, while there are scores of Chinese medical doctors, teachers and construction aid workers working in Lesotho.Xianyi also mentioned that in the field of project cooperation, the Chinese government sponsored Butha Buthe Industrial park that has just been completed and the National Library and Archives.

All Rights Reserved The Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) has reported that the Chinese National Petroleum Company (CNPC) has signed an agreement with the Mauritanian government to acquire two exploration blocks in the country. The report states that the CNPC has acquired Block 12 and two areas in Block 13. CNPC has committed to conduct exploration in the two concessions for a three-year period (extendable to six). If commercial quantities of oil are found, the CNPC will be granted a 25-year production license (renewable twice), with the Mauritanian government acquiring a 25% stake each time the license is renewed. Significance: Woodside's success in Mauritania, where the company now plans to develop new production, has increased the country's oil and gas profile. A number of smaller oil companies have been interested in acquiring new acreage in the wake of Woodside's discovery, but as yet there is no real consensus as to just how prospective the country is. The CNPC has sought to obtain interests in regions where the oil majors do not operate.

The irrigation systems include one for the commercial and research grapes and others for 20 settler plots. The construction of this infrastructure was made possible under a loan agreement between the two governments. Speaking at the ceremony, President Sam Nujoma said that the loan agreement was made possible by the continued excellent working relationship and cooperation between the two countries. Nujoma said that initially the Namibian government requested a loan from the Chinese counterparts for the construction of a pump station, a main pipeline and a reservoir. However, when this project was completed in February 1996 the two governments extended the loan to include a second phase that ended with the handing over of the houses and the irrigation systems. According to Nujoma, the objective of the project is to supplement national and household food security and to promote agricultural development in the country. The country also needs to earn foreign exchange and generate economic growth, he stressed. He said that a number of farmers from the previously disadvantaged groups will be trained and settled at Aussenkehr to make use of the facilities... Meanwhile, Chinese ambassador to Namibia Chen Laiyuan said that China attaches great importance to the continued development of the bilateral relations between the two countries. 'In the spirit of the Beijing Forum on China and Africa Cooperation, China is ready to explore together with Namibia, new ways and areas for further cooperation,' he noted. China has already undertaken several projects in Namibia. These include a day-care centre for children in Katutura, drilling and installation of 30 boreholes in the Omusati and Caprivi regions. Low cost housing projects in Windhoek, Gobabis and Katima Mulilo and the Northern Tannery and Leather Project in Ondangwa are some of the other projects the Chinese will be involved with...

China even invited the five African states that still recognise Taiwan (Malawi, Cape Verde, Swaziland, Gabon and Sao Tome and Principe), but it seems that none of them accepted the invitation.During the summit, the Chinese government is expected to announce an ambitious aid and trade package for the next three years.Aailable statistics show that trade between China and Africa grew at an average of 30 per cent a year between 2000 and 2005. Between January and September 2006, this trade reached 40.56 billion US dollars, and it is expected to exceed 50 billion dollars by the end of the year.This expansion is impressive, when one bears in mind that ten years ago trade between China and Africa was only one billion dollars a year.Projections in the Chinese press are that both China and its African partners want to see trade double (to about 100 billion dollars a year) within the next three years.China has facilitated this trade by exempting from tariffs more than 190 products exported by African countries. The results of this measure are clear: in the first six months of this year African countries exported to China 51 per cent more than they did in the same period in 2005, reaching 14.6 billion dollars.Trade the other way, from China to Africa, only increased by 30 per cent, reaching 11 billion dollars.Speaking to the Mozambican journalists who are in Beijing for the summit, Foreign Minister Alcinda Abreu dismissed as worthless allegations from some western quarters that China's real intention is to grab African resources.Cynics could say whatever they liked, but nobody would stop the cooperation A further area of cooperation is education, with China intending to increase the number of scholarships it offers for African students. By 2008, China should be providing around 4,000 university places for Africans. Mozambique will be among the countries to benefit.

You also concluded successful political, cultural, social and economic cooperation,' he noted.Changchun indicated that both parties share the same vision - to improve the living standards of the people and to foster peace and stability in both countries.He informed Nujoma that equipment and cash (to the tune of about 500,000 Namibian dollars) have been donated to the SWAPO-Party during an earlier visit by the delegation at the party's headquarters.The delegation met with SWAPO-Party Secretary-General and Minister Without Portfolio Ngarikutuke Tjiriange as well as other party members.Changchun informed Nujoma that the meeting included new ideas to foster partnership between the two political parties.Follow-up meetings will follow in due course, he said.Changchun indicated that the Mining Industry is one of China's priorities in Namibia.A wide range of cooperation between the two countries amongst others will include Information Communications Technology, power supply and a railway equipment purchase project.The delegation is expected to leave this Sunday [20 November].Source: Nampa news agency website, Windhoek, in English 17 No 05 //LUSAKA, No. 25 (Xinhua) -- Power demand in southern Africa will exceed the current installed capacity in 2007/8 thanks to the steady economic growth in the region which entails additional demand for electricity, according to a recent power report.Rhodnie Sisala, vice president of the Union of Producers, Transporters and Distributors of Electric Power in Africa (UPDEA) which is holding its 37th general assembly in Lusaka on November 24-25, said an additional 1,500 MW was needed each year upon the current capacity of 45,000 MW to cater for the increasing demand for electricity.Most of the activities in the electricity sector over the last year have concentrated on the action plans required to ensure that supply of electrical energy will not be a constraint to development in the southern African region.And the UPDEA southern African region utilities have been involved in various activities aimed at addressing the projected power deficit in 2007, increasing access to electricity and promoting regional integration.Earlier in 2002, the executive committee of the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) initiated the development of a regional project known as 'Western Power Corridor' (Westcor) Project to increase regional generating capacity for power generation and trading.The Westcor Project is intended to harness the hydroelectric energy of the Inga rapids site in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The planned installed capacity of the Inga 3 Power Station is 3,500 MW which will be transmitted through the countries of the participating utilities and interconnected to the rest of the SAPP transmission system.The cost of the Inga 3 Power Station and transmission liners are estimated to be 5.23 billion US dollars and five countries including South Africa, DR Congo, Botswana, Namibia and Angola are involved.

It would be wise to follow up with this project later, with the goal of possibly honing in on projects that our database has missed.

"1252","China","Possible foreign tracking space station","2003","false","Jan. 3-BEIJING-The news was presented by the government as a dazzling achievement: later this year, China plans to send men into space.Some Chinese indeed were thrilled by the declaration that China, still so backward economically in so many ways compared with the United States, will launch its first manned rocket, joining the U.S. and Russia as the world's only space-faring nations.But as the announcement filtered through the state media this week, public opinion seemed less than unanimous that China is choosing wisely to invest untold billions of dollars on a manned space program.Displaying the skepticism that China's urban population of 400 million sometimes feels toward its authoritarian government, people couldn't help wondering why a nation also overburdened by the poverty of 900 million peasants needs to explore the heavens.'I don't think it's directly related to ordinary people,' said Liu Guang Fu, 37, a copier repairman. 'It indicates China's high-tech and national defense level have improved a lot, but it must cost a lot of money, and to be honest, I would prefer the country use its resources in other ways. For example, China hasn't produced its own car.'Wei Gang Jun, 28, a sales manager, asked: 'Does this mean China is already a strong country? What benefit can ordinary people get from it? I only care about how much commission I can earn. People should be more realistic.'The government is calculating that most Chinese will be captivated by the launch of the first Chinese astronauts, sometime in the second half of the year, and it believes that going into space will give a powerful boost to national pride as well as make clear that China has ambitions to be a world power.The space program is already looking ahead to creating a space laboratory and landing on the moon by 2010, according to Ouyang Ziyuan, chief scientist of the moon program.'We will establish a base on the moon as we did in the South Pole and the North Pole,' he said in a lecture last year.China has been working to send men into space since 1992 and launched its fourth unmanned spacecraft Monday. Shenzhou IV-the name means 'divine vessel'-is fully functional to carry astronauts and has been modified from previous Shenzhou craft to make it more comfortable for living and working, officials said.A dozen former air force fighter pilots who became China's astronauts have entered the spacecraft to receive training, Su Shuangning, commander of the astronaut system, told state-run media.'With tough training in basic theories, professional skills, and flight procedures and tasks, the astronauts are absolutely capable of making their maiden voyage to outer space,' Su said.China describes its space program as 'indigenous,' but it is based on Soviet technology and has benefited from American prowess.Advances in Chinese missile technology have led to State Department civil charges against Hughes Electronics and a division of Chicago-based Boeing Co. over sharing of information with the Chinese.While the Chinese have received help from some quarters, the systems and spacecraft have been improved and re-engineered, suggesting China is capable eventually of catching up to the U.S.'They can do a very advanced spacecraft with a multiman crew and do several different missions, one of which will certainly in the future be several spacecraft [docking] together,' said Charles Vick, a space systems consultant who follows the Chinese space program.All countries that pursue space programs do so to advance basic scientific and technological research, but there can also be clear military applications, including improving rocket and missile science, advancing reconnaissance capacities, and mastering highly complex systems.'It really teaches much greater management-much better communications and overall procedures in the way you do things and not do things,' Vick said.The Chinese space system includes a launch center in the Gobi Desert, mission control near Beijing, four tracking ships anchored in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and two foreign tracking stations in Namibia and the Pacific nation of Kiribati.While China wants to avoid an arms race in space and is critical of U.S. ambitions to develop a space-based missile defense system, it is likely to gain some knowledge for space-based weapons through its program.But overall, space programs are expensive, and there is not a complete overlap between a civilian manned space program and military applications.'If you were looking at purely acquiring military capability, then a manned space program wouldn't be the most efficient way to go,' said Phillip Saunders of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif.In that way, Saunders said, China's venture into space may be mainly about prestige.'By doing a manned space program mainly on their own shows they are the technological equivalent of the superpowers,' he said.Wen Feng, 32, a hotel front desk manager, said the same.'Space will no longer only belong to those few Western countries,' Wen said. 'I'm sure those developed countries will respect China more. I'm very proud to be Chinese now.' //PAUL (Caller): Hi. Apparently, several ground-based tracking stations were used during this mission, and one is based in Namibia, I know for a fact. My question to the panel is what does this mean for the overall partnership in space between China and these countries? And also like maybe any contributions by these particular countries in some of these tracking stations and, in general, in terms of the geopolitical sort of arrangement. And I'll take my answer off the air.FLATOW: OK. Yeah, we have tracking stations around the world in different places.Mr. LOGSDON: Well, we don't too much anymore.FLATOW: Well, we had in the '60s.Mr. LOGSDON: But we had them for Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.FLATOW: Yeah.Mr. LOGSDON: This is basically no different. China has a fleet of ships that are used or deployed for tracking, and then they needed something in the African area and, apparently, just struck a deal with Namibia to locate a tracking station there. I doubt seriously that there's going to be a Namibian taikonaut anytime soon.FLATOW: Marcia Smith, do you agree?Ms. SMITH: Yes, I'e seen references in the Chinese press to the station in Namibia, but whether that is a forerunner of future cooperation, I really can't tell. But as I mentioned earlier, China does have a number of cooperative agreements in space with lots of different countries. You know, Brazil, European Space Agency and others.FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Does this signify at all--tell us anything about the next kind of satellite they may launch or, you know, learn anything about that?Ms. SMITH: The very next satellite they're going to launch?FLATOW: Yeah.Ms. SMITH: As far I know is going to be the next in this cooperative program they have with Brazil. It's called CBERS, C-B-E-R-S, China Brazil Earth Remote Sensing Satellite, which I think is supposed to go sometime this month.

The Namibian sea is highly productive,' he said.He appealed to the Chinese government to help Namibia by providing professionals to assist in the area of aquaculture.Iyambo noted that the Namibian fisheries sector is steadily growing and is well managed. About 20 per cent of Namibian fisheries contribute to world exports.He revealed that China offered N$15 million to Namibia to assist with aquaculture development.To ensure capacity training in aquaculture, 10 Namibians last year were sent to study in China.According to him, he wants at least 500 Namibians to be trained since there are few qualified experts in the field in the country at the moment.Recently, Iyambo said, they built a research institute laboratory in Kavango Region, where the Chinese assisted with equipment.At the same time, the Chinese Vice-Minister of Agriculture said Namibia and China are good friends and maintain good cooperation in many areas such as agriculture.He acknowledged the Namibian Government's empowerment of more women in the field of fisheries.Dun agreed to further cooperation in food security and help detect diseases in animals as well as protect the environment to ensure agricultural development.At the moment, China has 20 million fish farmers and is one of the biggest fishing nations in the world.'We have experience in this field and we want to share this experience with Namibia so that you develop in this field. We have experience to increase efficiency in fisheries, to increase income for fish farmers and improve life conditions. We will send technicians to work with you to push forward aquaculture,' Dun added.The Chinese delegation promised to enhance and promote student and information exchange programmes in fisheries between the two countries through diplomatic channels. He said the Chinese Government would like to support African countries to increase production through science technology.'We will dispatch more Chinese expertise. We will also provide seeds for fisheries,' said Dun.China will also provide capital, including small machinery and equipment to the fisheries ministry.'Bilateral cooperation is very good and also we can establish other new mechanisms with more technicians and equipment,' he said.It is the first time that a Chinese delegation in the fields of agriculture and fisheries visits Namibia.Members of the business community were also present in both delegations to consult on different products and markets.The delegation visited the oyster farm at Tunacor Fisheries in Walvis Bay.","Food Aid (non-disaster)","","520","Pipeline/identification","1","Grant (excluding debt forgiveness)","Namibia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020100128e61s00336&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , Recipient media or official","1","","China Ministry of Fisheries, Government Agency","China Ministry of Fisheries, Government Agency","1","","","Raw","0","Vague (Official Finance)","5","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020100128e61s00336&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , Recipient media or official","15000000.0","NAD","1.0756432121391","7.32122196115288","1904756.41","","","","","1","Namibia","565","275","Namibia","NAM","NA","516","728","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

The minister made the remarks in a joint discussion with a high level delegation from China led by the Chinese minister of construction Wang Guangtao. Kasu said the contract for the construction of the six-lane Express Way- the first of its kind, and the first toll road to be built- would automatically be granted to China with out having to compete in competitions. 'This project is a special offer to Chinese companies of choice to come with the necessary credit facilities and get the project without any international competition,' the minister said 'I do sincerely believe that the project will be monumental to the Chinese government and people if Chinese companies participate as suggested,' minister Kassu added. Leaving the express-way project aside, Kassu invited Chinese companies to engage in the manufacturing of construction materials in order to meet the new challenges of rapid development throughout the country in the construction industry 'We feel there is a big market for all types of construction materials in the country,' Dr. Kassu observed. 'Besides, with the smooth access to the neighboring countries and beyond the chances of the market to be expanded further, as a result of the Regional Economic Cooperation Agreements, is also high,' he added. The minister further noted Chinese companies can invest in equipment leasing business with fully equipped modern workshops backed by warehouse facilities for spare parts. Dr. Kassu said Ethiopia has given infrastructure development a priority, where 70 percent of the infrastructure construction projects in Ethiopia are being carried out by the Chinese construction companies. The visiting Chinese minister Wang Guangtao on his part said of his country's strong conviction to further step up its ties with Ethiopia. He appreciated the support the Ethiopian government is providing to Chinese companies working in Ethiopia in the construction sector. Guangtao expressed his government's desire to enhance the friendly cooperation between the two sisterly countries.

All Rights Reserved. No material may be reproduced except with the express permission of The British Broadcasting Corporation.China, one of the world's fastest growing economies, is increasingly looking to Africa to fulfil its monumental energy requirements in a strategic push analysts say marks sharp new competition for the continent's natural resources. China is turning to the African continent to satisfy its growing demand for energy and oil resources. As a result, some African economies are reeling under the effect of exposure to the Chinese economy.The following is the first of a series of write-ups of reports about relations between China and sub-Saharan African countries, filed by BBC Monitoring East African Unit between 8 and 24 January. This edition covers ramifications in African countries following the abolition of the WTO textile quota system, opening the world market to Chinese textile, which enjoys the lion's share of the market, as well as Chinese investments, aid to and ties with African countries.Subsequent 'China in Africa' digests will be filed weekly on Mondays at 0800 gmt; the reports, preceded by an intro, are arranged according to names of the countries in alphabetical order.African countries' concern over Chinese textile world market shareThe Chinese textile industry, which commands between 60 and 65 per cent of the world textile market, presents a threat to industries in Africa, where clothing and textile exports face decline following the 1 January 2005 expiry of the World Trade Organisation multi-fibre pact which imposed a quota system on textile exports, allowing nations like China and India to export unlimited amounts of clothing to the west. Countries like Cote d'Ioire, Lesotho, Mauritius, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe therefore have concerns about which markets will still be open to their production. (South African Press Agency web site in English, 1348 gmt on 21 January)The Lesotho development agency on Friday 21 January expressed fears that their textile industry faced decline. The Lesotho Factory Worker's Union said Wednesday 12 January said that six textile factories had closed and their foreign owners fled Lesotho, leaving some 6,650 workers. (Lesotho News Agency E-mail-Text in English, 0000 gmt on 13 Jan 2005)Officials and business leaders in Mauritius on 19 January said that less than a month after the abolition of global textile quotas, the once-booming clothing industry is already feeling the pinch. 'Against giants like China and India, there isn't a chance in 1,000 for us to compete,' said Francois Woo, director-general of the Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile, a leading manufacturer in Mauritius, which plans to open a company in China next January but has pledged not to cut back on operations in Mauritius. 'If in three years we still have a 30,000 to 40,000-strong work force, it will be exceptional,' he said. (Agence France Presse 0810 gmt on 19 January)The South African government initiated a task force to address the problem of surging imports from China, threatening to destroy the textile and clothing industries in May 2004. The team is expected to meet on 1 February after five dormant months. The South African Textile Federation has applied to the Department of Trade and Industry's International Trade Administration Commission for the invocation of the WTO China textile safeguards. The federation's president, Walter Simeoni, says the textile industry has lost 30,000 jobs in the past two years. The department's director for Asia, Willem van der Spuy, says it is 'necessary to find a lasting solution' such as solving the 'lack of competitiveness' in the industry. (South African Business Report newspaper in English, on 20 January)The government of Swaziland, the Swaziland Investment Promotion Authority, SIPA, and all other related agencies are gravely concerned at the latest developments clouding the textile and apparel industry in the country. About 70 per cent of the close to 30 textile firms, employing approximately 35,000 Swazis, already have no orders from the United States which means they might now be compelled to stop operations and wait for orders -or else close down completely.The managing director of a local textile company said 'US buyers were now preferring to buy from China where they could get as many items as possible due to its large textile production capacity.' (The Times of Swaziland in English, on 21 January, and The Swazi Observer in English, on 18 January)Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions says the Zimbabwean textile sector has been adversely affected by to massive imports of Chinese-made clothing. A Chinese-made bush shirt sells for between 20,000 Zimbabwean (three US dollars or 2.30 euros) and 50,000 dollars against 80,000 to about 200,000 for one made locally.Lovemore Matombo, the trade union president told AFP: 'It is actually destroying the local textile and clothing industry. We have got well over 75,000 people in the sector and many have closed shop and several people have been laid off. Last year alone, about 30 textile factories and shops downed their shutters.' (Agence France Presse 0546 gmt on 25 January)Chinese line of credit to AngolaThe Eximbank of China turned out to be the most valuable of all to Angola in 2004. The Angolan government obtained from it one of its most important credit lines using oil as collateral, valued at 2bn dollars, to finance, among other projects, the rebuilding and recovery of infrastructure destroyed during the war, notably the national railroads network, road repairs, bridges.The agreement, signed in March 2004 between Eximbank of China and the Angolan Government, provides for the funds to be applied towards projects to be presented by Chinese companies. 'Angola, with its 12 million people, expects an influx of about four million Chinese citizens during the period of application of the line of credit. 'Many Chinese companies have already been set up here but we are going to see many more arrive in the next 12 months,' said Bastos de Almeida, finance ministry spokesman. 'Several Chinese companies have already been awarded contracts and are operating in Angola's public works sector and many more are expected in 2005. Many countries are not happy because we are doing so much business with China. But Chinese companies are quick and efficient and much cheaper than many others. The Chinese credit line will be absolutely key to our economic activity this year,' he added.Negotiations are under way between both national airlines - Angolan Airlines, TAAG, and China Airlines - to invest in more frequent flights between Luanda and Beijing, via London, to respond to the growing traffic between the two countries.Many Chinese companies are already operating in the building sector in Angola, after having been given important contracts, funded by the credit line, to rebuild railway lines between the various Angolan Luanda, Benguela and Namibe provinces. In an effort to boost local businesses, each contract awarded to a Chinese firm would have to include at least 30 per cent involvement of Angolan companies and workers, he added.

The first sign of change of an era is that it is China that is reported to be assisting President Laurent Gbagbo's regime, which is finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet at the end of every month... just after the 6 November 2004 French bombings and the ensuing anti-French demonstrations that shook Cote d'Ioire, China made a gesture of solidarity towards that country to the tune of 1.5bn CFA francs.'The commentary then says: 'Although, the political aspect of this open commitment on the part of China has not as yet been officially mentioned, one can only note that the Chinese have come 'to compete' with the French in the economic field, where the French have invested more than '1.5bn CFA francs with more than 600 small and medium-sized enterprises, most of which have been hit by the November 2004 crisis.'The Chinese have invested in the mining and energy sectors, the latest case in point being the entry of the Chinese company, 'Sinopec Oerseas Oil   Gas Ltd' on the lucrative oil field CI-112, off the coast of San Pedro, where that company has taken 27 per cent of the block as compared with 27 per cent also of the US oil company, Vanco. A first well of this oil field will be drilled in February this year.China's interest in Cote d'Ioire has been attributed to Taiwanese influence in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Senegal.

China needs a lot of iron for its industries, hence you could attract them to invest in industries,' Dr Panitchpakdi said. (Dar es Salaam-based The Guardian web site in English, on 21 January)The Chinese government on 20 January donated 20 tonnes of cement and anti-malaria drugs worth about 9,500 dollars to Tanzania First Lady Anna Mkapa in aid of the Equality for All Fund. (Radio Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, in Swahili, 1700 gmt on 20 January)Zimbabwe's 'look east' policyZimbabwe continues to register remarkable growth in investment levels as 87 projects valued at about 353bn Zimbabwean dollars were approved by the Zimbabwe Investment Centre in 2004,' reports the Herald newspaper. Statistics indicate that 'China contributed the highest level of investments at 126bn dollars followed by India with 92.8bn, confirming that the government's 'look east' policy is beginning to bear fruit.' (Zimbabwean pro-government Herald newspaper web site in English, on 11 January)The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) 12 January received a total of 22 Troop Carrying Vehicles (TCV) from the Chinese government 'as a gesture of fostering the cordial relations between China and Zimbabwe'.The vehicles are set to 'transform the ZNA into a well-equipped, highly-mobile and hard-hitting force'. ZNA Commander Lt-Gen Philip Valerio Sibanda thanked the Chinese for the donation. He said the vehicles would go a long way in alleviating transport problems that the army has experienced of late.The Chinese embassy's charge d'affaires, Mrs Ma Deyun, said the vehicles were procured after the two countries signed an agreement for cooperation in different areas of interest. She said China and Zimbabwe have enjoyed good relations since the days of the liberation struggle and they have always supported each other in times of need. 'We are proud of the achievements we have made in various areas of cooperation,' said Mrs Deyun.Trade and economic cooperation between Zimbabwe and China has grown tremendously. Under the partnership with China, several joint venture companies have been established in the country. China also remains the biggest buyer of Zimbabwe's tobacco. Under the Zimbabwe-China Joint Commission, Zimbabwe has benefited through the Chinese government's concessionary and interest free loans and grants.(The Herald newspaper in English 13 January, Government-owned and controlled national television ZTV in Shona, 1530 gmt on 12 January)Zimbabwe is fighting an invasion of Chinese goods, locally known as 'zhing-zhongs', which trade unions and businesses say are undercutting local industry already struggling for survial in a bruised economy. Zimbabweans call Chinese products 'zhing-zhongs' a term which has taken on a derisive connotation to describe anything that is substandard, irrespective of the country of origin.Economists say the proliferation of inexpensive Chinese goods, although a worldwide phenomenon and especially acute in Africa, is partly fuelled by President Robert Mugabe's policy of looking to Asia after being shunned by the West. 'While China makes some very good products, there was quite an element of dumping here with factory seconds and rejects coming in, and this was true especially of footwear and clothes,' says leading economist Eric Bloch.Last year saw a major influx of goods from China, prompting the government to drastically increase the import duties on the merchandise that includes everything from toothpaste to clothes to electronic equipment and solar panels. 'It was a very serious threat and then the finance ministry on 25 November 2004 substantially increased duties to level the playing field,' Bloch told AFP.'Previously, the import duty was 10 per cent of value plus 60 Zimbabwean dollars (one US cent) for every kilogram in weight, now it is 100,000 dollars across-the-board for all items.'Footwear giant Bata, which has a factory in Zimbabwe, said sales had dropped 26 per cent in 2004, owing to the influx of cheap Asian, and especially Chinese goods. 'These imports continue unabated, with requests by the footwear industry to look at the situation falling on deaf ears,' said managing director Edwin Duthie. 'Unless some control is implemented, I can see 2005 showing a further decline,' said Duthie.Several shops in Harare have closed and have been taken over by people selling Chinese goods. (Agence France Presse 0546 gmt on 25 January)Interest in Southern SudanUnder the peace agreement, oil leases signed by the government during the war will be respected. The largest lease holders include the China National Petroleum Company.Experts predict that oil and gas companies will rush in to expand Sudan's oil production from the 345,000 barrels a day recorded in June 2004. The country has proven reserves of 635 million barrels, much of which could not be accessed during the war because of fighting. (Associated Press on 11 January)Sudan People's Liberation Movement, SPLM, leader John Garang on 23 January said on his return to Rumbek, southern Sudan, that his movement wants a balance of nations in the UN peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern Sudan.Despite China being among a handful of the countries that responded to the UN appeal to contribute personnel for a peacekeeping mission, the SPLM has reservations about it. SPLM/A officials say they would have reservations about any participation by Malaysia or China, because of their oil production joint ventures with the Islamist government in Khartoum, or by Pakistan due to its Islamic identity.

"1654","China","SKD Renovation Completed Inactive ","2007","false",">Jul 24, 2007 (The Inquirer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- >>Renovation works which have been taking place at the Samuel K. Doe (SKD) sports complex in Paynesville by the Government of the People's Republic of China have finally been completed and the keys to the facility given to the Government of Liberia. >>The official turnover ceremony took place on Saturday, July 21, 2007 at the SKD with a host of government officials led by the nation's chief patron of sports, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a number of sports authorities and other dignitaries in attendance. >>The turnover program during which the public was initially prevented from attending was later given zeal and momentum when President Sirleaf ordered that the gates be opened to allow in hundreds of eager Liberians, who had gone to get a glimpse of the newly renovated stadium. >>Although no sporting activities were held at the stadium during the turnover ceremony, the public trooped in the stadium to entertain themselves with cultural performances in the glittering stadium which had been in ruins for months. >>The brief late-evening turnover program witnessed the project manager of the stadium turn over the keys of the stadium to the Chinese Ambassador, Lin Songtin who subsequently handed it over to the government of Liberia through the Foreign Minister, George Wallace. Minister Wallace then gave the keys to President Sirleaf, who officially and formally presented it to the Deputy Minister for Youth and Sports, now Acting Minister, Mr. Jeremiah P. Witherspoon. Minister Wallace and Ambassador Songtian also signed the handover certificate of the SKD stadium renovation project. >>Speaking during the program, Minister Witherspoon expressed gratitude to the government and the people of the People's Republic of China for responding to the call of the Ministry by renovating the stadium and transforming it into a modern sports facility. He said by undertaking this task for the young people of Liberia was an indication that China is indeed a true friend of the Liberians. >>Minster Witherspoon explained that the stadium contains accommodation for many sporting disciplines to have equal access to the usage of the newly renovated multi-faceted stadium. He also lauded the President for her support and keen interest exhibited for the renovation project. He assured her that the facilities would not be misused. >>Making remarks prior to the turnover of the keys of the stadium, Chinese Ambassador Lin Songtian stated that the renovated stadium was a special gift from the People's Republic of China to the Liberian people for its 160th Independence anniversary celebration. He said the Chinese government hails the renovation as a symbol of its goodwill and friendship to the Liberian government and people. >>He disclosed that the renovation project covered the scope of repairing, reprising, upgrading and the additional building of the facilities ranging from studio contraction to digital scoreboard; public address system; core and track; lighting system; fire fighting system; monitoring system and telephone system. He put the total implementation cost to over 9 million United States dollars. He noted that the stadium has now been renovated and upgraded to modern international standard. >>Amb. Songtin further said the stadium had served as a symbol of friendship between Liberia and China as it had witnessed the ups and downs of the bilateral relationship between the two countries. He said football is important in Liberia for the national reconciliation, especially in this post war era. He said this is why the Chinese government has decided to renovate the SKD as one of the first major project after the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two nations in October of 2003. He said it is hoped that the renovated stadium would play its role in promoting national reconciliation, solidarity and unity of the Liberian people and further strengthen and consolidate the existing cordial relationship, friendship and partnership between the two countries and peoples. >>Receiving the keys, President Sirleaf expressed appreciation to the government of the People's Republic of China for the undertaking, which she said further hails the cordial and friendly relationship that exists between the two nations and peoples. The President then briefly recounted the history of the stadium, which she said represents the vision of the late President William R. Tolbert Jr., under whose administration the stadium was incepted and completed under the regime of the late President, Samuel K.

'I am happy that the first shipment of six containers of farming tools is already here, and the second shipment of 18 containers will call the port of within one week,' Lin said. 'Now it is time for the dear farmers of Liberia to be armed with farming tools, and work hard in your rich soil for your food sufficiency and better life,' Lin added. According to the Chinese ambassador, the tools are under a 'gratuitous assistance and is being implemented as a top priority'.

The farming tools bring to three the number of significant bilateral assistance to Liberia from the Chinese government since the inauguration of the Johnson-Sirleaf's administration last 16 January. Following the visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing to Liberia in January and a high-level Chinese military delegation in March, the Chinese government announced a 5m dollars interest-free new loan to the country and a 600,000 dollars assistance to build the capacity of the Liberian army.

Responding to these gestures, president Johnson-Sirleaf said 'This is another manifestation in a very concrete way of support in the partnership between Liberia and China that Liberians can enjoy.' Tens of thousands of Liberians are expected to return to subsistence farming activities following 14 years of civil war which had displaced them from their localities. Regarding the debt waiver, she said it was a surprise, but she assured that her government would work with the Chinese government on the gesture, reaffirming her government's support for the 'one China' policy.

"1624","China","Matured-Debt Cancellation (duplicate with ID: 1607)","2006","false","The many years of bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and Liberia, no matter the few strains experienced out of resumption of ties with Taiwan by previous governments, have been quite rewarding especially with the former providing needed economic and technical assistance to the latter either through grants or debt arrangements. Given Liberia's disposition in recent decades, however, especially with gradual recession witnessed in its economic outlook that has made it quite difficult in meeting some of its commitments to friendly nations and institutions. The nearly 15 years of civil crisis destroyed all amost all of its infrastructure, as well as institutionalized structures exacerbating the issue thus requiring the need to make adjustments suiting its abilities to make good on all previous national and international obligations. With the visit to the PRC by the democratically-elected leader of Liberia, Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in recent weeks, tremendous achievements have been made with that great country promising number of assistance including removing the heavy burden on the post-crisis government. Specifically, assurances given in various fields, as well as promise to relief the Liberian nation from matured debts by the PRC has indeed invigorated the spirit of planners and financial executives in charting courses that will once more see the Nation as being credit-worthy and an adherent to instruments legally-binding. From Beijing, The Analyst brings to you the unfolding developments on progress being made as a result of the Liberian leader's ongoing visit. Liberia stands to benefit from matured-debt cancellation by the People's Republic of China, President Hu Jintao has assured President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf who is currently on a visit to that great republic. The PRC has promised to assist Liberia with its capacity-building programs through training, build two village elementary schools, avail 13 scholarships for students in 2006/2007, as well as provide anti-malaria drugs worth RMB$1 million, reported to be on its way to the country. According to the latest dispatch from Beijing, an agreement on economic and technical cooperation already signed between the two governments will also result to a grant of RMB$40,000,000 grant, for the completion of various projects including the renovation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex in Monrovia. A memorandum of understanding also reached provides for general cooperation on the development of one of Liberia's seaports, as well as the exploration of mineral resources. According to the dispatch, the assurances were given on Wednesday when President Sirleaf met with the PRC leader, Hu Jintao, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, where she was formally received. During official talks, both leaders reportedly expressed happiness over the growing cordial relationship between the two countries and the mutual desire to increase cooperation in the economic and trade sectors. In a related development, Chairman Wu Bangguo of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) yesterday met with the Liberian leader in Beijing, at which the parliamentarian underscored the need to strengthen exchanges in the future between the NPC and the Liberian National Legislature. According to the Xinhua News Agency, during the meeting, Wu lauded Sino-Liberian relations since the resumption of ties, following a break in diplomatic ties with Taiwan in October 2003. 'China appreciates the Liberian government and its Parliament, for its adherence to the one-China Policy as well as its support to China's reunification cause,' Wu is quoted to have said. Wu further lauded the cooperation between China and Liberia, describing it as potentially huge, proposing further that his government would like to work with Liberia in exploring new ways and methods in materializing a consensus reached by both leaders that would benefit the two countries. Responding, President Sirleaf reiterated Liberia's unwavering stance in advancing diplomatic ties with China, terming it as an 'unswerving policy.' The Liberian leader observed that the achievements of China's economic reform are very impressive, adding that Liberia hopes to borrow from its experience, with the strengthening of cooperation in the fields of agriculture, fishery, infrastructure development and mineral exploration. President Johnson-Sirleaf is also due to attend the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation slated for November 4-5. Upon the first visit by the Liberian leader to the PRC, she was taken to the Shenzhen Province in Southern China, near the Hong Kong border, where she and the Mayor of the City, Xu Zongheng, expressed strong desires to promote cooperation between the two countries, particularly the Shenzhen State and the port-City of Buchanan in Grand Bassa County. President Johnson-Sirleaf is quoted as having assured Mayor Zongheng of her country's post-war reconstruction drive for renewal, noting that her visit to Shenzhen was to attract private sector partnership. Relations between the PRC and Liberia dates back to 1971 when the latter supported China's admittance into the United Nations. Although diplomatic ties have broken twice on premises of Liberia resuming ties with Taiwan in 1988 and 1997, which the Liberian leader attributed to 'narrow and short-term considerations by previous Liberian governments,' ties between both countries resumed in 2003. Meanwhile, latest reports speak about the presence of 48 African heads of state in Beijing to attend the China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit. The forum will highlight roundtable discussions between and amongst leaders, as well as business communities, aimed at establishing mutual cooperation. It is expected to be headed by Chinese President Jintao and Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi.

"1721","China","Construction of hospital Inactive","2010","false","Mar 19, 2010 (The Informer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has described as 'a promise fulfilled' the construction of the US$10M-100-bedroom hospital in Tapita, Nimba County, after she toured the facilities Friday, March 5, 2010.The colossal structure, which is expected to be one of the best modern hospitals in the West African region, is being constructed by the Chinese Government as part of that country's bilateral assistance to the rebuilding of post war Liberia.Chinese Ambassador to Liberia Zhou Yuxiao, who led the tour of the facilities, said construction work would be completed by July for the hospital to officially be dedicated before July 26 as part of programs marking Liberia's 163rd Independence anniversary.Making a brief statement after the tour, Ambassador Zhou, who later formed part of the President's weeklong tour of southeastern Liberia, told gathered Nimba citizens that the Chinese Government had wanted to build the Hospital in Monrovia and not Tapita.He related that 'But, the Mandan [President Sirleaf] said no, no we need it in Tapita more than in Monrovia. That's why the hospital is here.''Our plan is to turn it over to you before or on your independence day, July 26,' he said.Ambassador Zhou disclosed that the Chinese Government will fully equip the hospital and it will be the highest technologically advanced modern hospital in Liberia with sophisticated equipment.Though the Chinese envoy expressed elation that the project was near completion, he feared that such a gigantic building without doctors and qualified medical practitioners would not be a hospital.'So we need the doctors, we need the nurses, we need the technicians,' the Ambassador noted and disclosed that discussions were underway with the Liberian Foreign Minister to address the problem.Discussions, he said, are focusing on whether doctors and other professional medical practitioners will be imported from China to run the hospital while locals are being trained, or otherwise.He then commended the people of Taipta for their total cooperation and support to the work. He said unlike other areas where locals stole materials, the people of Tapita have never stolen any of the materials being used to construct the hospital.'In Nimba [there's] no stealing. I love Liberia and I love the citizens of Nimba even more,' the Chinese diplomat stated.For her part, President Sirleaf historicized that when she visited Tapita in 2006, she promised that her government would restore the damaged hospital there, after the people took her on the site.'I promised them that I will go and look into it and talk to some of our friends and we will put priority on this hospital,' President Sirleaf recalled telling elder of Tapita.President Sirleaf said her administration prioritized two major projects: the construction of the new university building at Fendall and the Tapita hospital, rather than rebuilding the Executive Mansion, where she should be residing and working.'This was done so that we can be able to keep our promises to the people; it is a promise fulfilled,' she stated amidst thundering applauses and battle cries.The President said when the Chinese Envoy inspected the area he told her that they would prefer building a new modern hospital instead of renovating the damaged one the initially stood there.'I'm happy that it has come this far,' the Liberian leader asserted, lauding the citizens for their good record with the constructors.

In Chambishi, 60,000 jobs will be created while less than a thousand jobs will be created in the high-tech economic zone. Many more jobs will be created in southern province,' said Mutati.In Chambishi, the Chinese planned to construct a copper smelter and other projects in mining and agriculture.Authorities had agreed to orient the Chinese on Zambian labour laws and culture to avoid tensions similar to those which forced Chinese President Hu Jintao to cancel a trip to Chambishi during a visit to Zambia in 2006.Zambia's opposition and labour unions accuse the Chinese of failing to observe safety standards and of paying workers salaries below the government minimum wage threshold of about 70 Zambian kwacha.'There are some things they need to learn and they have told us they are willing to do so,' Mutati said, adding that Zambia had opened its doors to Chinese investors because 'they are different from the West and tend to be quicker in transactions which make sense.'ZAMBIA-CHINA/ (INTERVIEW)|LANGEN|AFA|CSA|LBY|RWSA|RWS|REULB|GNS|BNX|SXNADocument LBA0000020070626e36q0018f","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070626e36q0018f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report","1","","","","","","","Raw","0","OOF-like","3","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070626e36q0018f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report","300000000.0","USD","0.8379948373178","1.0","357997432.25","","","","","1","Zambia","551","288","Zambia","ZMB","ZM","894","754","Commercial","1","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

"2351","China","Kinkon dam renovation","2006","false","InCONAKRY, July 19 (Reuters) - China has upgraded one hydropower dam in blackout-prone Guinea, the world's top exporter of the aluminium ore bauxite, and plans to modernise another, state radio and diplomatic sources said on Wednesday.China has ramped up investment and diplomatic activity in Africa as it seeks new supplies of energy and raw materials to fuel its fast-growing economy.State radio said the Guinean government took possession of the Kinkon dam at Pita, some 400 km (250 miles) north of the capital Conakry, on Wednesday after a $2.5 million overhaul and upgrade which increased its capacity to 3.4 megawatts from 3.0.Diplomatic sources in Conakry said China was planning to renovate another hydropower dam at Tinkisso in the east of the country.In December a Greek company, 3PL, which has a joint bauxite exploration venture with Aluminium Corp. of China Ltd (Chalco) in Guinea said it had signed a deal to build a 1.2 million tonne alumina refinery in the northeast of the country.An alumina plant would require significant energy resources but it was not immediately clear whether the dam overhauls were linked to this development. Alumina is extracted from bauxite and then smelted into aluminium.Despite living on top of one third of the world's bauxite reserves, most of Guinea's 9 million people survie on less than a dollar per day. A general strike last month over rising living costs triggered rioting in which at least 11 people died.The government says it has spent around $500 million on its power grid and new diesel generators in recent years, but Conakry and other towns still face frequent power blackouts, which have been exacerbated by high fuel prices.'Each one of these generators costs us the equivalent of 350 litres of diesel per hour -- that's nearly $9,000 a day at the current exchange rate,' said Sidy Diallo, spokesman for state power utility Electricite de Guinee (EDG).In May, China offered to build a 50,000-seat soccer stadium free of charge to help Guinea's bid to host the 2012 African Nations Cup tournament.ENERGY-GUINEA-CHINA|LANGEN|GNN|AFN|Z|ABN|O|OIL|C|MTL|E|RBN|RNP|DNP|PCO|PENDocument LBA0000020060719e27j001fw中几合作第四次会议成功落下帷幕 中几两国政府第四次合作会议成功落下帷幕。会上两国就双方在“友好关系”各方面进行了回顾。      中几之间合作在中断了六年之后，今次取得了重大的进展。这是中国商务部副部长魏建国访问团访问科纳科里的重要成果。几内亚外交、合作、非洲一体化和海外几内亚侨民部部长阿卜杜-卡贝雷-卡马拉接待了魏部长访问团。      此次会面主要就医药卫生、矿业能源、教育、农业、商贸、交通运输等方面进行了探讨。      中几合作已经有50年的历史了，双方友好关系顺利发展。此次代表团的访问进一步加深了两国的关系。魏部长宣布向几内亚捐赠4千万元人民币（相当于6百万美金）用于实现建造乡村学校和医院；为几内亚独立50周年送上50辆“红旗”牌轿车；带来大量的食物和化学肥料等物资并将在几内亚建设一家现代医院用于疟疾防治和预防。      魏副部长也强调了中几两国的经贸合作关系。2007年，双方进出口额达到了367.000.000美金，是2002年的7倍。魏部长还表示希望两国年进出口额能达到10亿美金。      双方就此次访问表示满意并强调了增进双方互访的必要性。计划将于两年后在北京召开第五次中几合作会议。      Coba的蔗糖工厂，Mamou的农具工厂，Kinkon和Tinkisso的水电站，Sèkhoutoureya的人民大会堂，Sonfonia的发射中心，Koloma的电台新建筑，Nongo的5万座体育场……这些都是中国援建几内亚的项目，为几内亚提供了重要的支持也是中几友好关系顺利平稳发展的坚实基础。因此阿卜杜-卡贝雷-卡马拉也表示几内亚将制定矿业资源一揽子发展计划以支持和保证几内亚的交通、水电、农业等方面的基础设施建设总体规划。","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Hydropower","","Completion","3","Joint venture with recipient","Guinea","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060719e27j001fw&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report; http://www.becgc.net/chinese/show.php?itemid=106       , Local Language Source      , Donor media or official","2","","","","","","","Checked","1","OOF-like","3","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060719e27j001fw&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report; http://www.becgc.net/chinese/show.php?itemid=106         , Factiva        , Donor media or official","2500000.0","USD","0.74305214409552","1.0","3364501.43","","","19 July 2006","","1","Guinea","438","243","Guinea","GIN","GN","324","656","Commercial","1","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

At a meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, the king described the situation in the Middle East as 'sinking into a deadlock'. Jiang said that the key to the problem was the 're-establishment of the legal rights of the Palestinian nation' and that China was willing to work with the Arab nations to help maintain dialogue to resolve the situation. The following is the text of report by Liu Dongkai, entitled: 'Jiang Zemin meets with Morocco's King Mohammed VI' by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)Beijing, 5 February: Chairman Jiang Zemin met with Moroccan King Mohammed VI in the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. The leaders exchanged sincere opinions on bilateral relations and major international and regional topics of interest, and reached a broad consensus in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.Jiang Zemin warmly welcomed King Mohammed to China, and expressed his pleasure at once again seeing the King in Beijing. He said: Your excellency is the first Moroccan sovereign to visit China in the 44 years since China and Morocco established diplomatic relations, and I believe that your excellency's visit will become a milestone in Sino-Moroccan relations.Jiang Zemin gave high marks to relations between China and Morocco. He said: The friendship between China and Morocco is deep and long. In their long-term struggle to obtain their independence and be liberated, to protect their national sovereignty and dignity, and to promote world peace and development, the people of both nations have always shown each other sympathy and support. There has been sincere, friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation based on equality on matters involving economic development and construction of the nation. Today, we once more take a look backwards at history, standing here at a strategic height, and take long-term interests as our point of departure. We set the direction for the relations between our two nations in the new century. Jiang Zemin suggested that China and Morocco should continue their joint efforts on the following points:1. Establishing a long-term, stable friendly relationship of cooperation between the two nations for the future.2. Promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.3. Enhancing coordination and discussion to jointly protect the rights and interests of developing nations and protect world peace.Jiang Zemin praised Morocco's long-standing adherence to the viewpoint that there is but one China, and thanked Morocco for its support of China in the area of human rights. Jiang gave an excellent assessment of the Moroccan government and the king's hard work and successes in maintaining political stability, bringing about sustained economic growth and securing the welfare and happiness of the people, and expressed his heartfelt congratulations to Morocco on its continued progress down the road of national construction.When discussing bilateral trade relations, Jiang Zemin stressed that the Chinese government has always placed great emphasis on friendly cooperation with Morocco. He said: In recent years, both sides have enlarged the channels for cooperation on a daily basis, and diversified the forms of cooperation. This has been done to bring about positive social and economic benefits to both sides. China will work hard with Morocco on the basis of equality and mutual benefit to strongly enhance trade cooperation between the two nations, and to bring about common development.King Mohammed expressed his thanks to Jiang Zemin for the invitation to visit China and for the warm welcome he had received after arriving in Beijing. He gave fulsome praise to China's success in reform and opening, and said that in the 10 years since he had last visited China, earthshaking changes have taken place in China.King Mohammed gave a very positive assessment to the relationship between China and Morocco. He said: Relations between China and Morocco have been long and friendly, and the two nations have common viewpoints on many international issues. We have close discussions and interchanges at many international venues, and each has many experiences in economic construction which we can share and exchange. Morocco is willing to work hard with China to enhance bilateral cooperation in all areas, and to promote further development of relations between our nations.King Mohammed gave Jiang Zemin a brief introduction to his views on the Middle East problem. He said: Currently, the Middle East is sinking into a deadlock. I hope that China will play an active role in stimulating all the parties involved to quickly find a resolution, and to break through the deadlock and resume the process of negotiation.Jiang Zemin thanked the king for his summary. He emphasized that the key to the Middle East problem is a reasonable resolution of the Palestinian problem, and re-establishment of the legal rights of the Palestinian nation. Israel must return the occupied Arab territory. The principle of 'land for peace' cannot be dropped. He said that China has always firmly supported and has worked hard for the Arab nations in recovering their lost lands, and has supported the Palestinian people in recovering their legal rights as a nation, and is willing to work with the Arab nations, including Morocco, to maintain normal communications and discussions to continue to play a positive role in promoting an early resolution to the Middle East problem.Jiang Zemin expressed his approval of Morocco's constructive role and unique function as chair of the Jerusalem committee in maintaining the stability of the Middle East for the long term, and promoting the peace process.The two leaders also exchanged opinions on the fight against terrorism, Sino-African relations, the Chinese-African Cooperation Forum, and other international and regional issues.After the talks concluded, Jiang Zemin and King Mohammed VI appeared together at the signing ceremony for the 'Economic and technical cooperation agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Morocco,' and four other agreements and documents.Before the talks, Jiang Zemin formally welcomed King Mohammed VI to China.

'Upon completion of this project, we expect to have improved information transmission within the country,' he said.According to the agreement, about 70.4m dollars (93.5bn shillings) will be utilized to implement Zanzibar International Airport Terminal II project.Mkulo said that the funds will be used for the construction of Zanzibar international airport terminal two, a project which is very important for promoting tourism and general development of Zanzibar, Tanzania and east Africa. 'When completed the airport project will also stimulate other economic activities across the country,' said MkuloThe minister also asked the government of China to assist the historical Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (Tazara), since that corridor offers the shortest link between the port of Dar es Salaam and southern African countries.For his part, the Chinese minister said his government would continue supporting Tanzania in different socio-economic sectors.Meanwhile, the Chinese minister yesterday proposed measures to further develop Sino-Tanzanian economic and trade cooperation. Chen made the proposal during his meeting with Industry Trade and Marketing Minister Dr Mary Nagu noting that the bilateral economic and trade cooperation was currently developing rapidly with China's imports to Tanzania up 46.7 per cent in the first 11 months of last year and total Chinese direct investments in the east African country exceeding 200m dollars.The investment sectors have expanded into agriculture, pharmacy, mining and commodity production from construction, textile and transportation. A number of infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, power projects as well as water supply projects have been constructed through bilateral cooperation, the Chinese commerce minister said.He added that the development of Sino-Tanzanian development aid was going smoothly, and the eight measures announced at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Summit to promote the bilateral cooperation had been comprehensively implemented.In order to further develop the Sino-Tanzanian economic and trade cooperation, Chen proposed measures to continue expanding bilateral trade as the two sides had already exchanged documents on tax exemption to some export products to China under the new measures announced at the fourth ministerial meeting of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on 8 to 9 November, last year, a move that would lead to expansion of Tanzania's exports to China.The Chinese minister also stressed the strengthening of investment cooperation, initiating the negotiation and signing agreements on investment protection and exemption of dual taxation, which would create an advantage to expand China's investment in Tanzania as well as local job opportunities.Source: The Guardian website, Dar es Salaam, in English 16 Jan 10ab564b91","Multisector","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Grant (excluding debt forgiveness)","Tanzania","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020100116e61g000ul&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report","1","","","","","","","Raw","0","Vague (Official Finance)","5","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020100116e61g000ul&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report","2900000.0","USD","1.0756432121391","1.0","2696061.27","","","","","1","Tanzania","510","282","Tanzania","TZA","TZ","834","738","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

"2430","China","Pipelines (Duplicate of 1649)","2011","true","563 words23 August 201106:56 AMReuters NewsLBAEnglish(c) 2011 Reuters LimitedBEIJING, Aug 23 (Reuters) - China's state energy giants are cautious about oil and gas investment under the rebel-ruled government in Libya, concerned about the uncertainty of a new regime and believing European firms will be politically favoured.(For a related story on China urges Libya to protect investments: )Instead companies like CNPC, CNOOC and Sinopec would be more comfortable providing services in oil prospecting, oilfield engineering and drilling, areas they focused on in the era of Muammar Gaddafi.The following gives a snapshot of Chinese firms' main oil-related activities in the north African nation.CRUDE SUPPLY PACTUnipec, the trading arm of state oil firm Sinopec, has a yearly crude supply pact under which China shipped in about 150,000 barrels a day last year, roughly 3 percent of the country's total imports.China started to raise sharply imports of Libyan crude oil since 2009 as a domestic refining boom prompted firms to scout for new supplies.Imports in the first four months of this year averaged 131,000 bpd, customs data show, before being cut off from May.Traders said the lost supply has been covered by oil from the Middle East.OIL SERVICESChina's oil firms have barely any equity oil production in Libya. Instead, they have focused on services, with two CNPC units -- Great Wall Drilling Co and BGP Inc -- among the most active in Libya. CNPC had about 400 staff there, CNOOC 77 and Sinopec less than 10.A Beijing-based oil service executive told Reuters on Tuesday that he expected engineering and service companies to return to Libya soon.'Post-war reconstruction needs more petroleum engineering services and these services are politically less sensitive and normally are done through international tenders,' he said.CNOOC's oilfield service company had four drilling rigs operating onshore.PetroChina , CNPC's listed arm, has no investment there. Sinopec's spokesperson Huang Wensheng said the firm would look out for new opportunities in Libya.'But the key is whether there will be good ones. The political situation is just too unclear. We have yet to conduct risk assessment on Libya, which is a necessary step in our overseas investment,' Huang said.PIPELINES, FAILED ACQUISITIONCNPC won a $230 million contract in 2002 to build twin 520 kilometre oil and gas pipelines for Italian firm Eni that link the Wafa field in south Libya with Melitah, about 50 km away from Tripoli.CNPC was forced to end a $417 million bid to acquire Canadian oil producer Verenex Energy Inc in 2009, after the Libyan government refused to approve the deal.CNPC was among the 47 qualified foreign firms to compete for acreage in an oil and gas licensing round in 2006.OTHER CONSTRUCTIONApart from oil services, Chinese state firms were building railways, houses and water supply projects in Libya.One such company, China Metallurgy Group Corp, was building a 5,000-apartment residential project and also infrastructure for a cement factory. The firm said in March that some 5 billion yuan ($780 million) of the contract was unfulfilled.China Railway Construction said early this year that about $3.55 billion worth of contracts in Libya were suspended due to the war.(Reporting by Chen Aizhu, Su Dan and Xu Wan; Editing by Michael Urquhart)CHINA-LIBYA/OILReuters LimitedDocument LBA0000020110823e78n000iz","Unset","","","Unset","","Unset","Libya","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020110823e78n000iz&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report","1","","","","","","","Raw","0","Unset","1","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020110823e78n000iz&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report","","","","","","","","","","1","Libya","620","133","Libya","LBY","LY","434","672","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"

LOME, Togo (AP) - As followers drummed and danced, Togo President Gnassingbe Eyadema laid the corner stone for a new multimillion-dollar presidential palace being built by the Chinese for the poor west African nation. Telecommunications Minister Faure Gnassingbe -- the president's son -- called the project 'a priority for Togo,' saying it would give the nation a palace 'befitting the dignity and status of a modern presidency.' Chinese diplomats and Togo leaders at Thursday's ceremony declined to give an exact price. The palace is the latest high-profile gift from the Chinese as they vie across Africa and much of the developing world for diplomatic recognition, in competition with Taiwan. Chinese also are competing with the West for oil, minerals and other resources in many West African nations. Other Chinese-built landmarks for Togo include a recently constructed US$36 million sports stadium, a hospital, and the Palace of Congress. Laying the cornerstone, Eyadema declared, 'The people of Togo are happy to celebrate with you the glory of Sino-Togolese friendship.' Eyadema took power in 1967 after Africa's first post-colonial coup, and stands today as Africa's longest-ruling leader. International rights organizations accuse his regime of suppressing the opposition and charge him with widespread rights abuses, and most aid to the tiny country remains frozen. A nation dependent mostly on commercial and subsistence agriculture, Togo has more than one-third of its 5.4 million people living in poverty. With development and economic reform stalled, roads and other infrastructure are crumbling. Opposition leaders condemned the mansion project. 'What Togo needs is a solid foundation for the country's move toward multiparty democracy,' said Cornelius Aidam, vice president of the Convergence Pan African Patriotic Party.

The plant would be in Kabwe at the former Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines lead and zinc mine which was closed in 1984.Company deputy general manager, Lee Ke Kun, told Platts Thursday that the company would obtain its raw manganese from its high grade manganese operation in Mkushi, a district in Central Zambia, known for its abundance of manganese deposits. He said the company would have no market problems for its product as the plant would be the first of its kind in Zambia. Lee Ke Kun did not say how much manganese the company would process.Zambia's most notable manganese operation was in Mansa, northern Zambia, which once hosted the country's only dry cell battery manufacturing plant. The manganese mines at Mansa, however, have been unproductive since economic liberalization policies led to the collapse of the battery factory in the late 1990s. Also, data released by alternative investment market and Franfurt listed Red Rock Resources plc in April 2006 indicated that manganese samples from the Mkushi prospect returned analytical results of up to 52% manganese.

We are almost at the point of closing the deal,' Chitundu told Reuters.Chitundu said Zesco, which engaged China's Sinohydro last year to start the Kariba North bank expansion project had already spent $18 million on the project, where a fire damaged the plant and killed two workers a fortnight ago.Chitundu said Zesco will also seek a total of $220 million from the Africa Development Bank (AfDB) and European Investment Bank (EIB) to develop the Ithezi-Tezhi power project, where 120 MW will be generated.Zambia generates 1,400 MW of electricity and consumes about 800 MW during the day, but demand rises to 1,500 MW at peak during the night.ZAMBIA-POWER/|LANGEN|AFN|Z|SF|ABN|C|MTL|D|DNPDocument LBA0000020091005e5a5000jo","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Pipeline/identification","1","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=LBA0000020091005e5a5000jo&cat=a&ep=ASE       , Factiva      , International media report","1","","","","","Zambia Electricity Supply Corp.

This is good news for us and we will work towards improving the operations of the company,' he said.The minister said since the country's economy was growing, it would require a reliable railway line to match with the increased production of copper and agricultural activities in various parts of Zambia.He paid tribute to the Chinese Government for the support to Zambia's various development programmes and TAZARA in particular and that the loan would help the company operate effectively.He said a team of experts from China would soon be dispatched to work with the TAZARA management to evaluate its viability and to carry out a comprehensive study on how it could link other countries through the railway network.Prof Lungwangwa reiterated his Government's commitment to contributing to the development of the country through infrastructure development, among others.Last month Zambia, Tanzania and the Chinese governments met in China to discuss the possible funding of TAZARA.Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Li Qiangmin said he was confident the negotiating teams would reach a conclusion and reiterated his government's commitment to supporting Zambian programmes aimed at contributing to the economy.Mr Li said the financing of TAZARA was a clear testimony of the good bilateral relations that his country and Zambia have enjoyed over the years, which have continued to grow.President Rupiah Banda and his Tanzanian counterpart Jakaya Kikwete had earlier appealed to creditors to cancel TAZARA debts to rescue the railway firm from collapse.The two leaders further called on the board of directors to expedite the process of concessioning management and operations of the railway company to a competent railway enterprise from China.The railway line, built in the early 1970s through the assistance of the People's Republic of China, is seen as the icon of friendship between the three partner States, China, Tanzania and Zambia.The railway also facilitated the opening of trade links between Tanzania and other landlocked neighbouring countries.Document AFNWS00020100112e61c000gp","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","","Completion","3","Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","Africa, regional, Tanzania, Zambia","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020100112e61c000gp&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=       , Factiva      , International media report","1","","","","","","","Raw","0","ODA-like","2","Unset","","Inactive","2","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020100112e61c000gp&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=         , Factiva        , International media report","39000000.0","USD","1.0756432121391","1.0","36257375.64","","","","","3","Africa, regional","510; 551; ","282; 288; 298","Tanzania; Zambia; Africa, regional","TZA; ZMB; ","TZ; ZM; XR","834; 894; ","738; 754; ","Not Commercial","2","false","false","false","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset","Unset"
