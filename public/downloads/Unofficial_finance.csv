"21563","China","Diamond mining licensing","2010","false","In 2010, the Zimbabwean government licensed three diamond investors to extract the gems in Chiadzwa on a 71,000 hectare plot, but companies are only mining on about 40,000 hectares. The licenses were granted to Sino-Zimbabwe, a joint commercial entity between the Chinese government an Zimbabwe. Another Chinese company, Anjin, and Pure Diamonds, were also given concessions in the Chiadzwa diamond fields.  Anjin is a joint venture between the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (10%), the Zimbabwe Defense Industries, or ZDI, (40%) and Chinese investors (50%). There is some discrepancy as to the 10% ownership. Sources suggest that the 10% is actually owned by a company called Matt Bronze, which is controlled by the Zimbabwean army. The remaining companies include Mbada Diamonds and Marange Mineral Resources. As of 2011, Anjin had produced 1 million carats of rough diamonds, subsequently awaiting the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme to start exporting. There appeared to be some human rights groups that strongly opposed the methods of extraction. Anjin alone had invested over $310 million USD in its mine and development of infrastructure in the area where families were relocated. More than 400 four bedroom homes, blair toilets, and thatched huts have been built. In addition, the company has also built a clinic, a primary school, and a secondary school.

SINOPEC, China's biggest oil refinement corporation, will contribute about $2.4 billion USD to the project.  The $2.4 billion bid covers government signature bonuses of $2.2 billion and $200 million investment in social projects.  The company won a 27.5% stake in block 17, a 40% stake in block 18 and a 20% stake in block 15. These three blocks will bring Sinopec approximately 100,000 barrels of oil output per day after they go into operation next year. Block 15 holds an estimated 1.5 billion barrels of oil reserves, block 17 approximately 1 billion barrels and block 18 is estimated at 700 million barrels. It is estimated that the three oil fields have combined oil reserves of 3.2 billion barrels and will allow SINOPEC to produce about 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Sinopec held a 75% share in the consortia Sonangol Sinopec International (SSI), while Sonangol of Angola had the remaining 25%.

In December 2009, retired Chinese admiral Yin Zhuo said that setting up a naval base in the Gulf of Aden region would bolster China's long-term participation in antipiracy operations. The Chinese Defence Ministry ruled this out for the time being, but military experts in Beijing said an overseas supply base 'might be an option in the future'. The status of this project is uncertain. STAFF_NOTES: This project has the potential for being for military use, but there is not enough information on the development yet.

Ltd. planned to team up with an Africa development fund set up by the Chinese government to build a 200 mW gas-fired power plant in Ghana. The firm plans to form a venture in Ghana with the China-Africa Development Fund to develop the project, estimated at $137.2 million USD). The project would be installed with two generators currently used at power plants owned by the listed firm and its parent. The 200 mW power plant will be the first phase of a 560 mW project planned in Ghana. In April of 2008, Ghanaian president John Kufuor took part in the ground breaking ceremony at the power station at Kpone near Tema. There is some debate over the actual value of the project; it is possible that the project is actually worth $143 million USD. The project will be conducted by Sunon Asogli Power, the joint venture between Shenzhen (60%) and the Development Fund (40%). The first phase was completed in April 2009. Later, the capacity will be increased to 560 MW. The first phase was completed within 15 months [August of 2009]. It appears that further construction may have increased the value of the project to $600 million USD, but it appears that the project is still being implemented.

The project, known as the Zimbabwe Smallholder Smallholder Irrigation Project, will be the largest irrigation project in Zimbabwe when completed; the centerpiece of the project is the Dande River dam which will story 46 cubic meters of water for the irrigation of 4,300 hectares of land in Zimbabwe. Construction on the project was supposed to have started in March 2000 with completion scheduled in July 2003, but it is clear that the deadlines have since been changed. Construction has started and stopped multiple times, and as of 2005, the project was still under construction.

Since operating permits are only granted to companies incorporated under Gabonese law, the Chinese entities interested in manganese in Ndjolé merged to form a Gabonese company under the name of C.I.C.M.G. (Compagnie industrielle et commerciale des mines du Gabon).  The joint venture company - known as the Industrial and Commercial Mines Company of Gabon (CICMG) - will invest some 1.275 billion CFA francs (US$2.4 million) in exploration activities, ahead of a decision in February 2006 on whether or not to exploit the deposits. According to Onouviet, Gabonese and Chinese workers will be employed on the 621 sq. kKm site. Reports indicate that the joint venture did secure exploration rights., but further information cannot be found at present.PIAF-ID:367","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","Manganese","320","Implementation","2","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Gabon","http://echogeo.revues.org/12547

The signing ceremony occurred at the Cape Sierra Hotel between the Chairman of the National Tourist Board of Sierra Leone and Chairman of the Henan Guoji Corporation, Messrs Sahr E. Gbomor, and Zhengzhou Jinshui. Also at the signing ceremony was Cecil Williams, General Manager of the National Tourist Board of Sierra Leone. The Chinese company Henan Guoji Industry and Development Corporation Ltd. plans to construct a luxury hotel complex, convention center, and oceanside promenade. This project is perceived to bring a rise in Sierra Leone's tourism industry, as well as engender job growth for the country. The project was expected to begin within twelve months with the construction of a 250-bed hotel and conference center. However, the project was controversial because it involved draining wetlands, giving rise to serious environmental concerns. Henan Guoji was forced to downsize the investment to $100 million USD, pending the clearance of the Sierra Leonean government. The project appears to be untied, but it is unclear whether or not construction began.","Trade, Tourism, Banking and Financial Services","","330","Implementation","2","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Sierra Leone","http://www.ccs.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dfid-3rd-edition.pdf

The project will also create 2,500 jobs for Mauritanians, but critics argue that roughly 40,000 jobs will be lost. However, local businesses and fishermen will face tough competition in the fishing industry, and the project may place a strain on the area's resources.

"25227","China","ZESA and CATIC sign a cooperation agreement","2004","false","On November 4, 2004, the Zimbabwe state-owned electricity utility ZESA Holdings Limited signed a cooperation agreement with Chinese state-owned company CATIC (National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation) worth US$2.4 billion; the agreement was comprised of a series of smaller deals.The largest of these projects was a US$386 million agreement was signed between the Zimbabwean national electric utility, Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), and its subsidiary, the Zimbabwe Power Company, and the state-owned Chinese company China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corporation for the construction of two 300 mW electricity generation units, Units 7 and 8, at the Hwange Power Station worth US$368 million. According to a Zimbabwean government document, the Zimbabwean government and ZESA will secure the loan with contract-farmed tobacco exports to China as well as giving CATIC a 70% share in the Hwange Power Station. At the signing agreement were the visiting chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, Wu Bangguo; the vice-president of CATIC, Wang Dawei; and the chairman of ZESA holdings, Dr. Sydney Gata. Construction on the project was expected to commence in January 2005. However, June 2005 report stated that CATIC would not honor its pledge to invest with ZESA to upgrade the Hwange Power Station with two units of 300 mW each unless it was guaranteed coal concessions in return by the government of Zimbabwe, and that construction on the project was 18 months behind schedule at the time. Additionally, a March 2012 Zimbabwean media report indicated that the Zimbabwean government was taking new bids for this same project to expand Hwange Power Station (including the same specifications) from a number of new companies suggesting that probably cancellation of CATIC's deal with ZESA from 2004. The project has been suspended until a new firm can be established.The next largest portion of the agreement was a US$143 million financing agreement between the CATIC and ZESA for the development of a domestic capacity to manufacture electricity distribution equipment. The Chinese delegation was led by the Visiting Chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, Wu Bangguo, while the recipient company ZESA was represented by the company chairman, Dr. Sydney Gata. Additional research into project implementation updates was unsuccessful.The smallest announced portion of the agreement was a deal the Chinese government signed with ZESA worth US$40 million for the domestic manufacture of electrical transmission equipment. ZESA was represented by its company chairman Dr. Sydney Gata. Additional research into project implementation updates was unsuccessful.The remaining funds have been distributed among a series of projects, including a rural electrification project. It is unclear exactly how the remaining funds were used.It is noted that this project was signed at the same time as Project ID#17149, but there is no indication that the expansion of Kariba-South falls under the same overarching agreement.An additional source:http://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja ved=0CCUQFjAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.siis.org.cn%2FSh_Yj_Cms%2FMgz%2F201202%2F2012711142130JPQ5.DOC ei=qaZkUO6XM6Tz0gGj24HIBg usg=AFQjCNEIbQnvlaqWY0Lsdo2sdKBJPgeZwg","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","230","Pipeline: Commitment","11","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Tied","4","Zimbabwe","https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:7c3JROSBhrgJ:www.rbz.co.zw/inc/publications/legaldept/rbzpdfs/Supplement4.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgWm4c1GM57OK5gu00QG4yAjAL_1v

"211","China","PPIAF - License for 17,0 Manganese Mines","2006","false","In 2006, the  private company, Huazhou Mines Investment Co. Ltd won the license for the 11520 square kilometer Njielei Manganese Mines with the support of Gabon's Minsistry of Mining. The license came after a year of mining exploration. In 2007, CITIC Dameng Mining was approached by the Ningbo Huazhou group and formed a strategic cooperation with Ningbo Huazhou Mining Investment Co. Limited in Gabon. It was agreed that CITIC Dameng Mining and Ningbo Huazhou Mining should jointly pursue and invest in potential mining activities in Gabon, taking advantage of the exploration and mining interest held by Ningbo Huazhou Mining through its subsidiary CICMHZ.  It is unclear whether CITIC Dameng is involved in this project. This appears to be the same project as listed here: 'Deposits Ndjolé will be operated by the Chinese group, who presented the Minister of Mines, feasibility studies conducted since 2006. Four years later, the Chinese can now move to the operational phase of the exploitation of this mineral, located at Bembele Mountains about 36 km from the city of Ndolé and 200 km from Libreville. Its reserves are estimated at 30 million tonnes grading an average of 40%.To ensure service quality, the Chinese operator plans to invest 17 billion FCFA. So that in its second year, the company will produce one million tons of manganese a year. And it plans to hire 300 Gabonese the mine site, with the key building hospitals, schools and strengthening existing structures.'This paragraph may also be relevant: Manganese production at the M’bembélé mine, located at Ndjolé, which officially went into operation in the second quarter 2011, is expected to reach 500,000 tonnes per annum. The commissioning of the site was accompanied by the building of an electrical power station and 225 km of railways to connect and supply the site with power. This project is a problem project mainly because Huazhou is involved in several mining ventures in Gabon in different areas, and it is often unclear which site is being referred to by news articles.  The first step in better assuring the quality of this information should perhaps come from determining the relationship between the Nijelei mines, the M’bembélé mines and the Ndjole mines.

The contract is for one year of oil supply, and is eligible to be renewed for 5 years. Si Bingjun, managing director of PetroChina, and Edmund Daukoru, special adviser to Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo on Energy and Oil Matters, signed the contract on behalf of their respective sides. At a rate of 30,000 barrels per day, China would have accumulated 10,950,000 barrels in the 5 years. No evidence can be found for the completion of this contract, however the Jamestown foundation speculates that several other oil deals built off of this one.

"630","China","CMEC iron infrastructure in Belinga","2005","false","On April 21, 2005 China National Machinery and Equipment Import/Export Company (CMEC) announced plans to manage an infrastructural investment in Belinga. The investment would include the construction of 200 km of railway, a new deep water port and a hydroelectric dam, at a cost of around 300 billion CFA franc (US$600 million). Original plans stated that the project would begin in 2008. In 2007 or 2008 (depending on sources), CMEC signed an official 25-year agreement with the Gabonese government to carry out the project. Controversially, the agreement between CMEC and the government guaranteed that China would benefit from 90 per cent of the wealth that the mine generated. The project was delayed, partially by protests from a nonprofit group called Brainforest concerned about the environmental impact of the dam. CMEC agreed to begin the mining project by 2011, but did not begin the project on time. On February 4, 2012 Gabon and mining firm BHP Billiton reached a deal that BHP would carry out the project, and the contract was taken from CMEC. 

STAFF_NOTES: There is some discrepancy over the financial and other quantitative figures.  According to Xinhua News, the agreement signed between CMEC and Gabon includes 560 km long railway, a deep water port 25 km from Libreville, and other ancillary works, including the construction and maintenance of power plants.  The project is expected to take three years and the total cost is about USD$3,000,000,000.  The cost will be covered by sales revenue generated from the iron ore.  At its peak, it is expected that the project will generate 25,000 jobs for Gabon.

"1276","China","US$1 billion for oil and gas exploration and development","2005","false","In January of 2005, Circle Oil signed an agreement with China Shine H F, where the latter will earn a 72% interest in Circle Oil's Namibian license.To complete the earn-in, China Shine must drill no less than three wells to depths of between 5,000 meters and 7,000 meters to test prospects delineated during previous exploration programs and acquire no less than 3,000 line kilometers of 2D seismic data. China Shine estimates a budget of over US$1bn for the Namibian project. The funds will be spent on exploration, development and infrastructure upon successfully completing the initial farm-in requirements. However, in 2008 it appeared that China Shine was unable to fulfill its commitments. Namcor, the Namibian state oil company will retain a 10% share, Petroholland (a Dutch oil company based out of Dubai) will acquire a 70% interest in the license by paying $15 million USD, However, current Namibian Minister of Mines and Energy, Isak Katali, has expressed that Petroholland has not signed the petroleum agreement nor made payments to the Namibian government for the license. Executive director of Petroholland, Hiskia Auchab, told the press that the company was ready to clear the debt within the time frame given by the Namibian government, but it is unclear if the company has done so at this time.It seems that there could be another project prior to this one regarding First Africa Oil acquiring 40 million acres in Northern Namibia for oil exploration in 2003, then acquired by Circle Oil Plc. in March of 2004. However, there is little-to-no information on it.STAFF_NOTES:Nature of flows are unclear in this record, could potentially not be a valid project, however it is already cancelled.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","320","Cancelled","0","Joint venture with recipient","Tied","4","Namibia","http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&tx_ttnews%25252525255Btt_news%25252525255D=51081&no_cache=1

It would run parallel with an older pipeline called Line2, from Nairobi to Eldoret for 326.2 km and pass 7 pumping stations. Shengli work for the project includes rebuilding two existing pump stations (PS21 and PS24) and two terminal stations, constructing three new pumping stations (PS22, PS23 and PS24) including a transmission substation (PS26), procurement   construction for auto-control system of station and fire-extinguishing system, and construction   commissioning for electric equipment.  The project was delayed in 2008 by KPC due to insecurity in some parts of the country. The project formally began on May 20, 2010 and Shengli officials scheduled its completion for May 24, 2011.

The Chinese funded foreign direct investment Madagascar Energy was required to invest at least US $17.5 million on oil exploration.

Madagascar Energy received an entitlement to 45-73% of the profit from Block 3113. The rest of the profit would go to the Madagascar government.In 2009 the company had progressed significantly in its exploration of Oilfield Block 3113. The exploration looked optimistic for future earnings, and Madagascar Energy judged the field an oil and gas condensate field.  Wikileaks reveals that in January 2010, the Chinese firm Yanchang bought 15 percent of Sino Union (look to #1017).  Kaiyuan then acquired five percent of Sino Union shares in February 2010.

In November of 2011, plans to build a 10 gW renewable-energy power-plant were revealed. Referred to as the Lesotho Highlands Power Project, the power would come from 6 gW of wind energy and 4 gW of pumped-storage hydro power. The project cost is estimated at 110 billion ZAR, and it was stated that most of the finance would come from in the form of loans from unnamed Chinese firms, while the equity for the project would come from Breeze Power, a joint venture between the Lesotho government and South Africa's Harrison   White Investments (HWI). Construction on the first phase is slated to begin in 2012 with the first 150 mW wind farm. 600 mW of the wind capacity is supposed to be online by 2016. As part of this project, manufacturing facilities will be built in Lesotho and South Africa. Later, Ming Yang Wind Power was confirmed as a major supplier of turbines for this project. Two new contracts were signed with Mops Civil for the construction of a 3.8 km access road  and with South African BKS for the construction of the measuring weir river barrier. The road was completed in November 2011 while the weir was still under construction and expected to be completed by September 2012. The timeline for this project is as follows: environmental and social baseline studies between August 2012-July 2020, construction tenders from November 2012-January 2015, construction of advance infrastructure from July 2014-December 2015, construction of the Polihali dam and tunnel to start in January 2016 and end in March 2020, a pump storage feasibility study to be completed in August 2012 with provisional construction to run from January 2013-December 2017, and impounding a reservoir to 2,000 meters above sea level to finish in August 2018, with the first water being delivered to South Africa in August 2020. Water and Environment Minister Edna Molewa was quoted as saying that loan capital for the dam portion of the project had not yet been secured.STAFF_NOTES: Since the financing seems to stem for unnamed Chinese firms, the project's classification was left as Vague (Commercial).

The Chinese representatives at the signing ceremony ware the chairman, Manuel Vincente, and the deputy general manager, Kelvin Kwan, of China Sonangol International while the Zimbabwean representatives included the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, who signed the agreements regarding gold and platinum refining, and Robert Mugabe's chief secretary Meshack Sibanda who represented the President of Zimbabwe at the event. A five-member delegation of representatives from China Sonangol performed a follow-up visit to Zimbabwe during December 2009; the delegation, led by company representative Dr. Steven Yin, carried out feasibility studies and research into oil and gas in the Zambezi Valley part of Zimbabwe.  Further research into firm start and end dates for the implementation of this loan in Zimbabwe was unsuccessful. A later media report from October 26, 2011 contained information suggesting that the Zimbabwean national, government-owned flag carrier, Air Zimbabwe, used an undisclosed amount of the money from the China Sonangol group to try to procure two Airbus long-haul airliners for use on routes to Europe and China through the European company EADS, European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, and the French aviation consulting firm, Reliance Aerospace Solutions. The Zimbabwean government was represented in the deal with China Sonangol by the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Infrastructural Development.","Infrastructure, Energy and Mining","","320","Pipeline: Commitment","11","Foreign direct investment (no public support)","Unset","","Zimbabwe","http://denfordmagora.blogspot.com/2009/11/china-angola-pump-s8-billion-into.html

Meanwhile, the export credit in question is being insured by Chinese state-owned insurer Sinosure. A major part of the agreement includes the provision of equipment for the building of a fiber optic network running from Chitungwiza to Plumtree with future plans to extend cables from Harare to Mutare, Bulawayo to Beitbridge, and Bulawayo to Victoria Falls. The project was expected to commence in October 2004 with a completion date 18 months later in April 2006. Powertel Communications was represented by the Managing Director Cletus Nyachowe. A Zimbabwean media article reported that the agreement was not officially reached and signed between the Zimbabwean government and China Putian Corporation until February 21, 2005 with equipment for the project not due to arrive in Zimbabwe until March or April 2005 instead of the originally intended dates.
