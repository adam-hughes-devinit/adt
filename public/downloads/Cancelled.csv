In return for their work on the power station, ZESA will give CETIC a 70% share in the South Kariba Power Station while using proceeds from exported tobacco grown through contract farming to retire the loans from the Chinese company. Also involved in the negotiations was the manager of general affairs for ZESA, Obert Nyatanga. A report from June 8, 2005 indicated that construction on the South Kariba Power Station had not started and was 18 months behind schedule as a result of ZESA failing to guarantee additional coal concessions to the Chinese firm in exchange for their work. It is likely that this project was indeed cancelled per media reports from April 26, 2010 that China awarded Sinohydro, a separate Chinese company, to complete these same specific expansions to Kariba South Power Station (Project #21063).

Gecamines was also entitled to royalties equal to 1.5% of gross sales revenue for the first three years of production, and 2% for the remaining life of the project. COVEC was reported to have employed 30 nationally Congolese employees. After an analysis of the partnership in 2007, a Gecamines commission declared that because no feasibility study had been produced in a reasonable time, and COVEC had failed to produce evidence that the contract had been approved by the Chinese government, that COVEC must give Gecamines a loan of 60 million USD to recoup its losses. The Commission left the possibility of re-starting the contract open, but terminated it in what was called a final report on the contract.

"630","China","CMEC iron infrastructure in Belinga","2005","false","On April 21, 2005 China National Machinery and Equipment Import/Export Company (CMEC) announced plans to manage an infrastructural investment in Belinga. The investment would include the construction of 200 km of railway, a new deep water port and a hydroelectric dam, at a cost of around 300 billion CFA franc (US$600 million). Original plans stated that the project would begin in 2008. In 2007 or 2008 (depending on sources), CMEC signed an official 25-year agreement with the Gabonese government to carry out the project. Controversially, the agreement between CMEC and the government guaranteed that China would benefit from 90 per cent of the wealth that the mine generated. The project was delayed, partially by protests from a nonprofit group called Brainforest concerned about the environmental impact of the dam. CMEC agreed to begin the mining project by 2011, but did not begin the project on time. On February 4, 2012 Gabon and mining firm BHP Billiton reached a deal that BHP would carry out the project, and the contract was taken from CMEC. 

STAFF_NOTES: There is some discrepancy over the financial and other quantitative figures.  According to Xinhua News, the agreement signed between CMEC and Gabon includes 560 km long railway, a deep water port 25 km from Libreville, and other ancillary works, including the construction and maintenance of power plants.  The project is expected to take three years and the total cost is about USD$3,000,000,000.  The cost will be covered by sales revenue generated from the iron ore.  At its peak, it is expected that the project will generate 25,000 jobs for Gabon.

However, in 2008 it appeared that China Shine was unable to fulfill its commitments. Namcor, the Namibian state oil company will retain a 10% share, Petroholland (a Dutch oil company based out of Dubai) will acquire a 70% interest in the license by paying $15 million USD, However, current Namibian Minister of Mines and Energy, Isak Katali, has expressed that Petroholland has not signed the petroleum agreement nor made payments to the Namibian government for the license. Executive director of Petroholland, Hiskia Auchab, told the press that the company was ready to clear the debt within the time frame given by the Namibian government, but it is unclear if the company has done so at this time.It seems that there could be another project prior to this one regarding First Africa Oil acquiring 40 million acres in Northern Namibia for oil exploration in 2003, then acquired by Circle Oil Plc. in March of 2004.
