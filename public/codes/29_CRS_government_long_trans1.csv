Subsequent sales and changes in land ownership, coupled with periodic, selective, partisan and politically motivated settlement of squatters at various times by the government, has heightened rivalry between the two groups. In 1992, the rivalry between the Soys and Ndorobos culminated in tribal clashes. A recent spate of violence between October 2006 and April 2007 left 144 dead and displaced 63 000 (10 292 families). It has been noted that both clashes occurred during an election year. This project will examine the relationship between tribal animosity, land ownership and political rivalry in the area. It will also seek to shed light on the nature and raison-d'être of the Sabaot Land Defense Force (SLDF), a militia that has been accused of gross human rights abuses, even by the communities to which it claims affiliation.
